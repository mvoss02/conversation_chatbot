007 Theme... 1 1
EXT. SNOWY FOREST - DAY 1 1
Wide on a peninsula between two large frozen lakes on a 
monochromatic vista.
CUT TO FOLLOWING a MAN hobbling through the snow weakly. He 
carries a gun.
He clears the trees, pauses, before descending a slope 
leading him out of frame, revealing...
A LONELY HOUSE
Wreathed in snow. Lights in the windows. Straddling the icy 
shore.
INT. HOUSE - DAY 2 2
CLOSE on a cigarette in a woman’s propped up hand, an ember 
glows in its tip.
A CD plays French seventies electro-punk.
The WOMAN lies on a couch, half asleep, a drop of red wine in 
a glass on the coffee table, pain killers an anti-psychotics 
sprinkled around it.
She calls to her daughter: MADELEINE.
INT. UPSTAIRS - DAY 3 3
MADELEINE, twelve, plays with a handheld video game.
YOUNG MADELEINE
(all in French, serious)
You want to eat again? You eat too 
much because you’re depressed.
MOTHER (O.S.)
Madeleine!
HEARS her mother, gets up. 
YOUNG MADELEINE
(in French)
Yes?
FOLLOW BEHIND HER as she goes for the stairs.
2.MOTHER (O.S.)
Madeleine!
YOUNG MADELEINE
(in French)
Yes Mama?
MOTHER (O.S.)
(in French)
I’m thirsty my angel.
YOUNG MADELEINE (O.S.)
(in French)
I’m coming.
WE CONTINUE PUSHING towards a large triangular transom 
looking out at the snow where THE MAN trudges towards us.
YOUNG MADELEINE (O.S.)(CONT'D)
(in French)
Do you want your medicine?
MOTHER (O.S.)
(in French)
Yes, my darling.
Now we TILT DOWN to the KITCHEN below. Madeleine fills a 
glass from a box of wine.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 4 4
Madeleine hands the wine to her mother, watching her flatly 
as the mother takes a long gulp, the cigarette teeters on the 
edge of the coffee table between the scattered pills.
The following dialogue is all in French.
MOTHER
Do you want to play a game?
YOUNG MADELEINE
I’m waiting for Papa to come home.
MOTHER
What do  you think Papa does?
YOUNG MADELEINE
He’s a doctor.
Madeleine’s mother laughs.
YOUNG MADELEINE(CONT'D)
He heals people.                                                     2.
3.MOTHER
Your Papa, he kills people.
YOUNG MADELEINE
No.
MOTHER
Is that who you love? Murderers?
Madeleine looks at her mother. Her mother drops her wine 
glass.
INT. KITCHEN 5 5
Madeleine opens the cupboard under the kitchen sink, gets out 
a sponge and a jug of ammonia -- marked flammable.
Her eyes dwell briefly on a compact BERETTA 92 wedged behind 
the pipes.
INT. LIVING ROOM 6 6
On her knees, Madeleine blots out the stain on the carpet 
with rhythmic SQUASHES.
A shadow crosses her. She stops, senses something... carries 
on cleaning. 
Then a second SQUASH joins in like FOOTSTEPS on snow, off 
tempo from her own actions.
More curious than frightened, she clambers over her mother 
onto the couch, looking out the window. Nothing, not even an 
animal.
Turns to her mother.
YOUNG MADELEINE
Mama. Mama. Mama.
MOTHER
Leave me be. Go play.
Turns back - a DARK FIGURE wearing a pale JAPANESE NOE mask 
stands JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WINDOW.
She screams, falling back.
YOUNG MADELEINE
Mama!
But her mother just wants to sleep.                                                     3.
4.MOTHER
Leave me alone?
Madeleine runs out.
INT. HALL, HOUSE 7 7
Madeleine enters a code on a keypad. She pushes and bangs 
against the door but it won’t open.
YOUNG MADELEINE (O.S.)
Open!
EXT. HOUSE - SAME 8 8
We pan across a surveillance camera to reveal three CCTV 
screens showing the MAN trudging past.
INT. HALL, HOUSE - SAME 9 9
Madeleine turns and calls out to her mother.
YOUNG MADELEINE
Mama!
She hears the CRUNCHING OF SNOW - moving towards the kitchen.
She follows it with her head, her eyes. Then something 
SHATTERS behind her. The MAN in the mask stands at the end of 
the hallway.
She knocks a pocket door as she jumps to escape. It slowly 
closes in front of us.
We see the MAN through the reeded glass of the door, his 
image splintered.
He opens it.
INT. LIVING ROOM 10 10
The man walks towards Madeleine’s mother on the couch. She 
looks up. 
MAN
Is Mr White home?
MOTHER (O.S.)
No. He’s gone.                                                     4.
5.MAN (O.S.)
My name is Lyutsifer Safin.
We see Madeleine hiding, listening.
MAN (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Your husband killed my family.
MOTHER (O.S.)
I told you, he’s gone.
MAN (O.S.)
I know. This will hurt him more.
We hear gunfire. 
ON MADELEINE HIDING -- stifling her gasps.
The couch stuffing floats in the air. The man senses 
something, turns and makes his way to the stairs.
INT. UPSTAIRS 11 11
He climbs the stairs.
INT. BEDROOM 12 12
He enters Madeleine’s bedroom. We see her hiding under the 
bed. The man doesn’t see anything but as he’s turning to 
leave - the videogame beeps.
From her hiding place under the bed, Madeleine sees his feet. 
She holds her breath and waits.
The man turns back and raises his gun.
Madeleine rises, SHOOTS WILDLY, EYES CLOSED. Bullet after 
bullet hits the man. 
Until CLICK CLICK CLICK. The clip is empty.
She opens her eyes, the dark figure falls like a tree to the 
floor below.
In shock, she walks to the edge of the balcony and looks down 
on his body.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 13 13
Madeleine, tears in her eyes, looks down at her mother.                                                      5.
6.Moments later...
ON THE MAN’S broken MASK, his face marked by pitted skin and 
discoloured with green and purple marbling.
We track with it across the living room floor -- dragged by 
Madeleine, wearing just her parka and slippers.
EXT. LAKE HOUSE 14 14
Madeleine struggles to get him out of her house. She lets him 
drop, exhausted by the effort.
She drops to the ground, when suddenly the man sits up.
Her mouth is open but she can’t scream - she just runs.
The man rises and follows, a limp, bleeding, unhurried, 
relentless.
EXT. FROZEN LAKE 15 15
Slipping and sliding, Madeleine struggles across the expanse.
She looks back as she runs when she suddenly feels the ice 
shift.
SHE FALLS THROUGH THE ICE, disappears from view.
THE MAN walks on, until -
HIS POV, Madeleine hauntingly trapped beneath the clear ice.
HER POV, looking back up at this distorted cruel figure. 
She’s running out of air, BANGS on the ice, GUN SHOTS ECHO.
BULLETS streak past her on either side. The ice fractures and 
turns to slush.
HIS HAND reaches down into the freezing water. He pulls her 
out. 
EXT. GROTTO ON THE SEA, ITALY - DAY 16 16
SOUND OF OCEAN WAVES CRASHING.
Madeleine breaks the surface of the water as if Safin was 
pulling her out - 
She gasps but is frozen -- opens her eyes, he’s gone. It was 
just a vision.                                                     6.
7.BOND stands like Adonis on a lido overlooking the sea. She 
turns, feeling his eyes on her.
BOND
You okay?
Madeleine smiles, burying the past trauma. She’s been dealing 
with this for years.
MADELEINE
Yes. Let’s go.
She swims towards him. He can sense she isn’t telling him 
everything.
I/E. DB5 - MEDITERRANEAN ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON 17 17
Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 rounds a corner of a rugged 
precipitous road. Madeleine looks at Bond adoringly.
BOND
How’s the view?
MADELEINE
(smiling)
It’s growing on me.
(beat)
Can you go faster?
BOND
We don’t need to go faster. We have 
all the time in the world.
She rests her head on his shoulder as we lead them into a 
tunnel --
EXT. TUNNEL TO TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON 18 18
-- Following the DB5 now as we exit the tunnel and see an 
ANCIENT HILLTOP TOWN looming over a rugged valley.
EXT. PIAZZA SAN PIETRO CAVEOSO - LATE AFTERNOON 19 19
Bond drives through the piazza and parks the DB5. He gets 
out.
PORTER (O.S.)
Buona sera signore.
BOND
Buona sera.                                                      7.
8.Bond opens the passenger door for Madeleine. She gets out and 
they both stand, taking in the view.
EXT. VIA MURO, TOWN - DUSK 20 20
Bond and Madeleine are led up he stone walk by the PORTER. 
Bond looks over his shoulder, almost involuntarily scanning. 
She notices.
MADELEINE
You can’t help looking over your 
shoulder.
He smiles.
BOND
What?
MADELEINE
(kindly as much for 
herself)
No one’s coming.
BOND
I wasn’t looking over my shoulder.
MADELEINE
Yes you were.
BOND
Are we going to have a row about 
this?
He looks up at the burning paper floating down from windows 
above --
BOND(CONT'D)
What are they burning?
PORTER
Secrets, wishes, letting go of the 
past. Getting rid of the old, in 
comes the new.
INT. HOTEL ROOM, TOWN - DUSK 21 21
Bond and Madeleine kiss passionately as they move through the 
heavenly room overlooking the town. She pulls his shirt off 
round his shoulders to the floor.
MADELEINE
Je t’aime (I love you).                                                     8.
9.BOND
Je t’aime.
The passion turns into intimacy. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - SUMMER TWILIGHT 22 22
A record spins on a RECORD PLAYER. They lie in bed. He 
strokes her hair. He is looking at her.
BOND
Where did you go to? Today. By the 
water. Tell me.
MADELEINE
I’ll tell you if you tell me about 
Vesper.
BOND
(knowingly)
Is that why we’re here?
MADELEINE
She’s buried at the acropolis -
BOND
(gentle)
I know where she’s buried.
MADELEINE
Can you forgive her? For us?
BOND
I left her behind a long time ago.
MADELEINE
As long as we’re looking over our 
shoulder, the past is not dead.
Madeleine rolls away from Bond, gets up and walks to the 
desk.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
You have to let her go even if it’s 
hard.
She sits down at the desk with a notepad on it.
BOND
You mean, if we’re to have a 
future?                                                     9.
10.MADELEINE
Mmm-mmm.
BOND
So I do this and then..?
Madeleine jots something down on the notepad.
MADELEINE
I’ll tell you all my secrets.
BOND
Okay.
CLOSE ON the notepad: L’homme masqué (the masked man). 
Madeleine tears the page from the notepad, folds it over. She 
picks up a box of matches.
Bond watches her move to the balcony overlooking the town, 
shaking the box of matches playfully.
EXT. BALCONY, HOTEL, TOWN - SUMMER TWILIGHT 23 23
The hundreds of glowing fires spread across the town is 
breathtaking.
Madeleine lights the piece of paper. She watches it fall.
On Bond, he watches her.
INT. HOTEL, TOWN - DAWN 24 24
The first rays of the sun stretch across the room.
Bond moves to the desk. He writes something on the notepad 
and tears it off.
He moves to the bed, kisses Madeleine.
BOND
(whispers)
I’m going to go and do this and I’m 
going to come back for breakfast.
MADELEINE
(she smiles, knows he’s 
going to the grace)
Thank you.
BOND
And then you’re going to tell me 
where we’re going next.                                                     10.
11.MADELEINE
Home.
EXT. GRAVINA DI PUGLIA BRIDGE - EARLY MORNING 25 25
As Bond crosses the ancient bridge spanning a deep ravine, a 
small group of WIDOWED WOMEN veiled in black pass by.
Bond looks up to an acropolis silhouetted in the morning sun.
EXT. ACROPOLIS, KIOSK - MORNING 26 26
Bond approaches the kiosk.
BOND
Buongiorno. La tombe del Lynd (Good 
morning. Lynd plot, please).
An OLD MAN, the caretaker, steps out to meet Bond. He barks 
at a YOUNG BOY.
OLD MAN
(in dialect)
Take him to the Lynd grave.
The boy waves to Bond to follow him.
BOY
(in dialect)
Come.
EXT. ACROPOLIS - MORNING 27 27
The boy guides Bond to Vesper’s grave then hustles off 
leaving Bond alone to face:
CU on a portrait of a beautiful WOMAN, dark hair, pale skin, 
light eyes: VESPER LYND 1983-2006.
The image stings his eyes.
BOND
I miss you.
He takes a piece of paper out of his pocket and lights it on 
fire with a lighter. We see what he has written: Forgive Me. 
The embers fall to the ground.
Then...                                                     11.
12.Something catches his eye, something that shouldn’t be there. 
He frowns, bends down to pick it up
A  SPECTRE SEPTIPUS card lying at the base of the crypt.
He looks at it and frowns. Bond’s senses spike -- DEATH.
He dives to the side just as -
KABOOM
The paving stone at the front of the grave explodes violently 
in a horizontal plume of black smoke and sparks.
As the dust settles Bond comes to and works his jaw, his 
hearing is muffled and brain battered.
He pulls out a phone and speed dials -
Bond can’t hear, he is up and moving, looks at the phone, 
thinks he sees the call timer start -
BOND(CONT'D)
Madeleine?
He looks at the phone. He hangs up. He turns and runs towards 
town.
EXT. KIOSK - MORNING 28 28
Bond runs towards the kiosk. The young boy and the old man 
are gone, a phone dangles from the receiver.
EXT. GRAVINA DI PUGLIA BRIDGE - DAY 29 29
Bond is running, half way across the bridge, chasing after 
the young boy. The boy stops, turns and smiles at Bond. 
Behind Bond, a black Maserati approaches. The boy sees it and 
takes off.
Bond turns and sees the Maserati screaming directly at him.
Too far to run to the other side, he dives for cover behind a 
stone buttress along the wall.
The Maserati rams into his section of the wall but the 
buttress forces the car’s tyres up the wall and over him. 
Bond gets up and starts to run when a motorcyclist wearing 
shades, PRIMO, rides up from the other side of the bridge.                                                      12.
13.The PASSENGER in the Maserati fires shots at Bond.
Bond is stuck in the middle of the bridge with the Maserati 
at one end and Primo at the other end.
Bond dives, grabbing hold of a cable as he soars over the 
edge.
The cable breaks loose and snaps taught as he reaches the 
limit of its length. He swings down to a lower tier.
Primo takes off his shades, revealing a bionic eye, and looks 
over the edge angrily. He revs the motorcycle and takes off 
in pursuit of Bond.
EXT. LOWER TIER BRIDGE - SAME 30 30
Bond breaks through a door leading to a tunnel.
INT. PASSAGEWAY - SAME 31 31
Bond runs up a stone passageway.
EXT. VIA CASALE - DAY 32 32
Bond enters a terraced street. Hears Primo looking for him on 
the bike. Calculates.
Suddenly he dashes towards Primo into the alley below, 
tackling Primo to the ground.
They fight rapidly and roughly amongst clothes on lines in an 
enclosed patio. Bond gets the upper hand, wraps a clothes 
line around Primo’s neck and pulls it tight.
PRIMO
Blofeld sends his regards.
Bond about to finish him when -
PRIMO(CONT'D)
You know...Madeleine...
Bond stops. What?
PRIMO(CONT'D)
(smiling)
She’s a daughter of Spectre. She’s 
a daughter... of Spectre.                                                     13.
14.Bond knocks him out. Primo’s fake eye pops out, CLINKS down a 
couple of steps.
Bond looks at it, then at the bike.
Bond takes off on the bike.
EXT. PIAZZA DUOMO - DAY 33 33
Bond rides the bike up the piazza steps.
Bond gets airborne. He lands and rides through a church 
procession. He motors towards the hotel.
EXT. HOTEL COURTYARD - DAY 34 34
Bond enters. The porter from the night before looks at him 
like he’s a ghost.
PORTER
Your baggage is already down Mr 
Bond. As your wife requested.
Bond looks at him. She asked for this?
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 35 35
Madeleine approaches the mirror to put on some lipstick.
She sees Bond in the reflection. 
BOND
(very calmly)
You were right.
Madeleine turns to face him.
Bond is standing there covered in dust, blood dripping down 
his face, clothes ripped from the chase and the fight.
BOND(CONT'D)
Letting go is hard.
MADELEINE
James! What happened?
She walks towards him.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
What happened?                                                     14.
15.BOND
How did they know I was here?
MADELEINE
What are you talking about?
BOND
Madeleine, how did they know I was 
here?
MADELEINE
I have no idea...
BOND
Spectre. How did they know?
MADELEINE
What are you talking... I didn’t do 
anything. 
She looks panicked. The phone rings. Bond grabs Madeleine’s 
handbag.
BOND
We’re leaving.
He grabs Madeleine and they rush out of the room.
EXT. VIA MURO - DAY 36 36
They head down the path to the DB5. He pushes her in.
I/E. DB5 - PIAZZA SAN PIETRO CAVEOSO - DAY 37 37
Bond gets in the car and starts the engine.
MADELEINE
There is something I need to tell 
you.
BOND
I bet there is!
He revs the car, cold with rage, speeds off just as TWO 
PURSUIT cars nearly run into them.
The cars weave around the DB5 and handbrake turn to pursue as 
Bond gets to high speed on the ring road.
Suddenly Madeleine’s phone starts ringing.                                                     15.
16.BOND(CONT'D)
Pick it up.
The phone continues to ring.
BOND(CONT'D)
Pick it up.
Shaking, Madeleine takes the phone out of her handbag. We see 
the Spectre septipus appear on the phone’s screen. Bond grabs 
the phone from her, answers the call, pushes the speaker so 
they can both hear.
VOICE
(German accent)
It’s Blofeld my love. Your father 
would be so proud of you. Your 
sacrifice will be our glory.
Bond looks at Madeleine. His blood runs cold.
MADELEINE
I don’t understand...
Bond drives. The pursuit cars follow.
EXT. VIA D’ADDOZIO - DAY 38 38
A KID sits amongst a flock of SHEEP. His phone rings.
The following dialogue is all in Italian.
KID
Hello.
VOICE ON THE PHONE
Let the sheep out kid.
KID
Why?
VOICE ON THE PHONE
Because otherwise I’ll kill you.
EXT. VIA MADONNA DELLE VIRTU - DAY 39 39
Bond is driving fast down the ring road.
MADELEINE
James. Why? Why would I betray you?                                                     16.
17.BOND
We all have our secrets. We just 
didn’t get to yours yet.
EXT. VIA D'ADDOZIO - DAY 40 40
A Kid ushers a flock of sheep into the street. 
EXT. VIA MADONNA DELLE VIRTU - DAY 41 41
Bond drives. In his rearview mirror black cars accelerate to 
follow. 
Bond manoeuvres the DB5 as ANOTHER PURSUIT vehicle heading 
towards them blocks their way.
Bond hits a switch, the DB5 drops MINI-BALL GRENADES as he 
turns hard right onto a street filled with sheep.
The grenades unleash carnage on the pursuing vehicles. Bond 
180s, THEN speeds through the cars he just took out.
EXT. VIA FIORENTINI - DAY 42 42
The DB5 grinds against stone walls as it slides back onto 
another street.
MADELEINE
James. James, listen to me. I would 
rather die than have you think...
WHAM --
The DB5 is t-boned hard by a black SUV.
I/E. DB5 - PIAZZA SAN GIOVANNA BATISTA - DAY 43 43
The DB5 is violently SPUN sideways by the impact.
BRIEF SILENCE.
We see the car come to a stop as we pull back, revealing the 
bells of a church starting to TOLL. ALL AROUND THE BELLS 
RING.
The pursuit vehicles pull up. Suddenly everyone OPENS FIRE on 
the DB5. It’s protected but the SOUND INSIDE is deafening. 
They stop.
Primo steps from his car and advances towards them.                                                     17.
18.Primo steps up to the car and fires shot after shot into the 
windows with his assault rifle 
Madeleine panics as she watches Primo firing.
MADELEINE
James! Do something. James!
Primo continues firing into the windows. Bond barely reacts.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Say something James!
Bond turns to her.
BOND
(softening)
Okay.
He flicks another switch on the centre console. Front 
headlights drop down and gun muzzles reveal themselves.
Primo sees the muzzles and runs for cover.
Bond yanks hard down on the steering wheel. He stamps on the 
accelerator and the car spins into a 360 degree doughnut 
whilst the front guns open fire.
MEN dive for cover as bullets shred walls and buildings. Bond 
flicks another switch.
Smoke commences to belch from the exhaust pipes as the car 
spins creating a foggy wall.
The men rise and fire into the smoke as the DB5 disappears in 
a dense white smoke screen.
Bond steps on the gas.
I/E. DB5 - MODERN STREET - DAY 44 44
Bond speeds on. He takes another wide turn. Pedestrians jump 
out of the way.
I/E. DB5 - TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS 45 45
Bond whips the DB5 into a sliding stop in front of the train 
station.                                                     18.
19.INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY 46 46
Bond is energised -- 
BOND
Come on.
-- dragging Madeleine’s arm, leading her across the tracks to 
the opposite platform. A train waits.
He pulls her close, so close they can’t see each other’s 
faces. But we see his profound grief.
MADELEINE
So, this is it?
BOND
This is it.
Bond pushes her towards the train. Madeleine boards. She 
turns.
MADELEINE
How will I know that you are ok?
BOND
You won’t. You’ll never see me 
again.
The doors close and train starts to leave.
Madeleine moves down the car to keep him in sight but he 
disappears into the crowd.
CREDIT SEQUENCE
SUPERIMPOSE:                 FIVE YEARS LATER...
EXT. C MINUS TWO - LONDON - DUSK 47 47
We TRACK DOWN the face of a glass cladded skyscraper. The 
reflection of the street below is mirrored in the panes.
The camera stops and tilts in towards a long darkened hall -- 
we are upside down.
INT. HALLWAY - C MINUS TWO - SAME 48 48
THE CAMERA ROTATES to normal view as A SQUAD OF ARMED MEN in 
black stream from outside the broken window into the hall.                                                      19.
20.They are heavily armed and armoured wearing helmets that look 
like welder’s visors - standard issue Russian SPETZNAZ and 
night vision.
They unleash themselves from the rope that had guided them 
down the face of the building and quickly start making their 
way down the hall, weapons up and ready.
1ST VOICE (O.S.)
We are in.
2ND VOICE (O.C.)
Proceed.
INT. BREAKOUT ROOM, C MINUS TWO - SAME 49 49
VALDO OBRUCHEV, Russian, forties, squeamish, opens up the 
shared office fridge.
Pan to TWO SCIENTISTS, DOCTOR HARDY and DOCTOR SYMES. Symes 
is searching for something.
DOCTOR HARDY
(to Doctor Symes)
You okay?
DOCTOR SYMES
You know the SL5, the weaponised 
smallpox I was using this morning? 
Have you seen it? I put it... in 
the bloody...
Valdo takes a Tupperware container from the fridge. The two 
doctors turn to him.
DOCTOR HARDY
Valdo, you haven’t seen a tub of 
smallpox have you?
Valdo looks at the Tupperware container. We see: VALDO’S FOOD 
NO TOUCH!!! in bold red print. Underneath is a printed 
sticker labelled: SMALLPOX.
Valdo throws the container down.
VALDO
This was good soup. Now it is 
waste. Even if it is joke. Idiotic.
Symes and Hardy contain their laughter.                                                     20.
21.VALDO(CONT'D)
There is more complexity in my 
tomato soup than in both of your 
brains combined.
DOCTOR SYMES
Valdo, that’s so unkind.
VALDO
One day I will put Ebola in your 
tea and then I will watch as your 
faces sweat blood and I will be 
laughing.
DOCTOR HARDY
Nice. Keep your hair on.
DOCTOR SYMES
Wow! He’s got a terrifying 
imagination hasn’t he?
Valdo’s desk phone rings. He picks it up, angry.
VALDO
Doctor Obruchev.
A calm and soft spoken voice is on the other end.
VOICE (O.S.)
They are coming.
VALDO
Who?
VOICE (O.S.)
Spectre.
Valdo’s expression immediately shifts from anger to fear. He 
turns away from the watching office mates, listening as his 
heart races.
His voice lowers to a whisper.
VALDO
Safin?
VOICE (O.S.)
Do not try to stop them. This is 
what we have been waiting for.
Valdo inserts a USB dongle into his computer.                                                     21.
22.VOICE (O.S.)(CONT'D)
They will ask you to enter Bio-
Security Level 4 fridge and remove 
the weapon. 
The ARMED MEN make their way through the building.
VOICE (O.S.)(CONT'D)
No one must see what you are doing. 
They will not kill you. They think 
they need you.
The armed men shoot a SECURITY GUARD.
Valdo starts to transfer files from his computer to the USB 
dongle.
VALDO
They will not kill me. Transferring 
the files as we speak. Now...now 
it’s done. What do I do with it?
VOICE (O.S.)
Swallow it. Goodbye.
VALDO
Swallow the..?
Valdo pretends to his colleagues that he’s talking with 
someone on the phone.
VALDO(CONT'D)
Yes! I like animals! Bye-bye.
He hangs up, stuffs the USB dongle in his mouth and swallows.
The room goes dark as the power is CUT.
Reserve power automatically powers dim emergency lighting.
ANNOUNCEMENT
Danger. Illegal access detected. 
Secure all bio-hazardous materials 
immediately.
BOOM.
An explosion rips through the building.
THEN gunfire vibrates through the building.
The armed men storm in. Shooting everyone except the THREE 
DOCTORS.                                                      22.
23.One of the armed men, PRIMO removes his visor. 
The three doctors are rounded up by the armed men.
DOCTOR SYMES
Please, we’re scientists. We’re 
unarmed. We’re unarmed. What do you 
want?
Valdo looks around.
PRIMO (O.S.)
Valdo Obruchev.
Valdo raises his hand.
VALDO
Hello.
PRIMO
Open the Bio-Security Level 4 
fridge.
VALDO
And...er?
PRIMO
Give me the weapon.
VALDO
What weapon? We have...er...
Primo approaches Valdo, grabs him by the shoulder.
PRIMO
Heracles.
VALDO
It requires double authentication.
PRIMO
Which one?
Valdo indicates Doctor Hardy.
VALDO
Him.
Two armed men grab Hardy.
DOCTOR SYMES
Hardy. Don’t let them. Please.                                                     23.
24.Valdo and Hardy are lead away as Doctor Symes and some 
COLLEAGUES are shot by armed men.
INT. INNER LAB - C MINUS TWO - MOMENTS LATER 50 50
Valdo and Hardy are in BL4 level containment suits. 
Hardy opens the fridge and Valdo pulls out a cylinder filled 
with vials of a charcoal like substance that moves like a 
school of fish within the vial. He shows it to Primo who nods 
his approval.
INT. LAB HALLWAY - C MINUS TWO - MOMENTS LATER 51 51
Hardy holds up the cylinder from which Valdo carefully 
removes a vial. He hands it to Primo.
Valdo and Hardy place the vials into a briefcase.
Primo uses a special UV light instrument on the vial to 
confirm this is what he’s looking for. Satisfied, he pulls 
out his gun and shoots Hardy.
INT. C MINUS TWO - MOMENTS LATER 52 52
Explosives are placed around the lab as Valdo, Primo and the 
armed men stream out, leaving the lab.
ANNOUNCEMENT
Warning. Facility lockdown in 
progress. All exits are now sealed.
INT. HALLWAY ELEVATOR - C MINUS TWO - MOMENTS LATER 53 53
Primo’s men pry open the elevator shaft. He looks up and sees 
the elevators are parked at the top of the building, leaving 
the shafts open and clear.
We look down at what seems like an endless drop.
Primo’s men force Valdo into a special vest, the same kind 
they are also wearing.
VALDO
What is this? A safety belt, this?
Another pair of men haul a heavy cylinder apparatus to the 
elevator shaft.                                                     24.
25.VALDO(CONT'D)
Wow!
The men toss the cylinder into the void. As it falls, it 
sprays out a myriad of small magnetic spheres which attach to 
the metallic surfaces of the shaft. A red LED on each 
flickers to life. When the empty cylinder crashes to the 
bottom an explosive charge concealed within blasts a hole in 
the concrete, revealing an underground passageway.
Primo and his men activate their vests and a light on each 
turns from red to green. Simultaneously, the lights on the 
magnetic spheres in the shaft also turn green.
Primo signals to his men and one by one they leap into the 
void. Valdo is led to the precipice and he looks down the 
empty shaft with fear.
VALDO(CONT'D)
I cannot! That is not elevator!
Suddenly he’s pushed from behind and he screams with terror 
as he falls down the shaft.
As he falls past the magnets the LEDs change colour as they 
flip polarity. Slowly, his speed is reduced until Valdo comes 
to rest several feet above the exposed hole. 
VALDO(CONT'D)
Magnets!
He hovers for a brief moment until the light on his vest 
changes and he drops through the hole.
The remaining men drop. Primo checks his watch and presses a 
button. He leaps into the shaft just as the corridor behind 
him explodes in a giant BALL of FLAMES.
A floor high up in the building glows as the fireball 
consumes the upper level of the building.
EXT. LONDON - EVENING 54 54
Establisher the London skyline.
INT. MI6 - EVENING 55 55
CLOSE on a memo marked: URGENT. Pan up to MONEYPENNY walking 
through the main office.                                                     25.
26.INT. M’S OFFICE, MI6 - SECONDS LATER 56 56
Moneypenny bursts into M’s office. M is lying on the couch.
MONEYPENNY
Sir, I’ve just received the most 
unusual...
M sits up quickly.
M
I’ve seen it.
He picks up a remote, turns on an array of monitors that 
stream live footage of the damaged lab.
M(CONT'D)
Jesus Christ!
MONEYPENNY
Sir, what’s the Heracles project? 
This lab isn’t on the books.
He swallows. It’s a nightmare, whatever it is.
M
No it’s not.
Not what she expected.
MONEYPENNY
There were casualties.
M
It was a gas leak.
MONEYPENNY
Shall I alert the PM--?
She turns to leave.
M
(stern)
It was a gas leak. I’ll handle it.
She is taken aback. M isn’t acting according to protocol.
M(CONT'D)
Moneypenny
(beat)
Where’s 007?                                                     26.
27.EXT. JAMAICAN SEA - BOAT - DAY 57 57
Bond, larger than life, bathed in sunshine, kicking back on 
his boat HAPPENSTANCE.
There’s a spear gun to his side, a couple of fish in the 
hold, his hand on the tiller.
To starboard, the green lush Jamaican coast, to port a dark 
brewing storm.
EXT. DECK - BOND’S HOUSE - DAY 58 58
Bond walks up the dock to his breathtaking water-side house, 
the fish dangle in one hand, the speargun in the other. 
He is visibly relaxed, walking at an island pace. A Bond 
we’ve never seen before.
He reaches his porch. Stops. Suddenly alert.
He sees discarded CIGAR ASH on the floor. This is not normal.
He slowly places the fish on the deck.
EXT. DECK TO BUNGALOW - BOND’S HOUSE - DAY 59 59
Bond crosses the deck leading to a detached bungalow, a 
pistol in his hand. 
He goes inside. Scans. Nothing.
Then he sees the CIGAR BUTT on the ground. Kneels down, picks 
it up. Looks at the label.
EXT. BOND’S SHOWER - DAY 60 60
Bond showers and cleans his teeth. He finishes and turns the 
water off.
EXT. DECK - BOND’S HOUSE - DAY - LATER 61 61
In fresh clothes, Bond walks back to the house, gun in hand.
INT. MAIN HOUSE - BOND'S HOUSE - DAY 62 62
Bond puts the gun into a drawer at his desk. A WEATHERED 
NEWSPAPER PAGE of Blofeld’s conviction is visible from inside 
the drawer.                                                     27.
28.I/E. BOND’S LAND ROVER - FOLLY POINT - DAY 63 63
Bond heads out in an old Land Rover.
He passes a WOMAN on the side of the road talking to a 
Rastafarian collecting stalks of Birds of Paradise.
She catches Bond’s eye.
I/E. BOND’S LAND ROVER - CRICKET FIELD - DAY 64 64
Bond drives past a local cricket match next to Port Antonio 
Harbour.
As the camera dollies across the game we land on the bumper of a 
RENTAL CAR (Ford Mondeo).
Its brake lights illuminate as the engine revs to follow Bond.
I./E. BOND'S LAND ROVER - WEST STREET SQUARE - DAY 65 65
Bond pulls into the square from West Street.
BUT, instead of parking, he ACCELERATES AROUND THE SQUARE -- 
SCREECHING out onto West street and nearly colliding with the 
FORD MONDEO -- it swerves and dips to a STOP.
BOND
(warmly)
Well isn’t this a surprise Felix!
FELIX looks up. Caught.
FELIX
(warmly)
James.
BOND
Who’s the blonde?
ASH smiles eagerly.
ASH
Logan --
EXT. ALLEY WAY - DUSK 66 66
Bond walks them past SCHOOL KIDS playing video games on TVs 
on a long table - like an outdoor home arcade.                                                     28.
29.ASH
-- Ash, State Department. Nice to 
meet you. I’ve heard a lot about 
you. I mean -- HUGE fan.
A couple of MEN bump into Ash calling “babylon” and “police 
bwoy” as they pass. 
FELIX
I need a favour, brother.
BOND
You didn’t get the memo. I’m 
retired.
FELIX
I wouldn’t ask if you were still in 
Her Majesty’s service.
BOND
And what does that mean?
FELIX
Our elected leaders aren’t playing 
nice in the sandbox. James, is 
there somewhere quiet where we can 
talk in private?
BONDS
Quiet? Yeah.
INT. VIP BOOTH, CLUB - NIGHT 67 67
Bond, Felix and Ash drink Heineken beers and shots in a 
packed dance club playing a coin game called SPOOK.
FELIX
I was hoping you could pick up a 
package.
Bond and Felix hold out their fists --
BOND
Five...
FELIX
FOUR.
Felix wins. They laugh.
BOND
Where’s the package?                                                     29.
30.FELIX
Short trip, Cuba. You love it 
there.
BOND
Oh, I love it there!
Bond and Felix laugh. Ash doesn’t know why.
Ash places a CIA playing card on the table, on it a 
photograph and bio of Obruchev.
ASH
Valdo Obruchev.
Bond knows the name.
FELIX
You’re going to say you’ve never 
heard of him...
BOND
Never heard of him.
They throw fists again.
BOND(CONT'D)
Two.
FELIX
Three.
Felix wins.
FELIX(CONT'D)
Ah, it’s a good life!
ASH
You never heard of him? Didn’t he 
defect during your tenure at MI6?
FELIX
Obruchev was kidnapped three days 
ago from a secret MI6 lab in 
London. Two days ago his mug pinged 
on a facial recognition sweep in 
Santiago de Cuba.
ASH
He’s leaving out the best part. 
Spectre.                                                     30.
31.FELIX
I have a contact there, says 
they’re gathering. 
ASH
Coincidence?
FELIX
C’mon it’ll be like old times.
They throw a third time.
BOND
Three.
FELIX
Two.
Felix’s fist is empty.
ASH
You’re really the only guy for the 
job. You’re the guy.
Bond looks at both of them.
BOND
My round.
He stands.
INT. BAR - CLUB - MOMENTS LATER 68 68
Bond walks to the bar where a WOMAN is picking up her drink 
order and turns to him. She looks him up, smiles.
NOMI
Hi.
He recognises her. The WOMAN (NOMI) from in front of his 
house.
She slides past him, looking him up and down.
Bond approaches the BARTENDER.
BOND
Scotch.
BARTENDER
Yeah man.
Felix joins him. Bond gestures to Ash.                                                     31.
32.BOND
Where’d you find the “Book of 
Mormon”?
FELIX
Political appointee, not my choice. 
Seems intelligence isn’t central 
anymore.
BOND
He smiles too much.
Bond and Felix look back at Ash, on his own. He smiles at 
them.
FELIX
Help us get this into the right 
hands.
BOND
What, and you’re the right hands?
FELIX
I’m not just a pretty face.
BOND
I stopped trusting pretty faces a 
long time ago, Felix.
FELIX
Yeah I heard. Bad luck.
BOND
Bad judgment.
FELIX
Harder to tell the good from bad, 
villains from heroes these days. I 
need you James. You’re the only one 
I trust with this. I’m not screwing 
around. I wanna get back to my 
family, tell them I saved the world 
again. Don’t you?
Bond drinks.
BOND
Nice to see you again Felix.
Bond goes to leave.
FELIX
At least take my number.                                                     32.
33.BOND
I’ve got your number.
Bond exits.
WE PAN AWAY as Felix leaves the bar. Primo (who we met in 
Matera) appears in frame.
EXT. JERK CHICKEN STALL - NIGHT 69 69
Bond finishes the last morsel of chicken. He’s at ease again.
He walks to his parked car and gets in. It doesn’t start. He 
tries again. Frowns.
He gets out, opens the bonnet. Sees something which makes him 
realise it’s never going to start. He hears the buzz of a 
scooter behind him.
It gets louder as it approaches. Then stops next to him.
The WOMAN from the bar (NOMI) is smiling at him.
NOMI
In trouble?
BOND
Constantly.
NOMI
Need a ride?
He looks at her scooter. Considers.
BOND
Sure. Why not?
He gets on the scooter.
NOMI
Hol’ on.
They drive off.
EXT. SCOOTER - ALLAN AVENUE - NIGHT 70 70
They zip along the quiet road.
BOND
(shouting forward)
What’s your name?                                                     33.
34.NOMI
(shouting back)
Nomi. What’s yours?
BOND
James. Call me James. What do you 
do, Nomi?
NOMI
I’m a diver.
BOND
What do you dive for?
NOMI
I have a thing for old wrecks.
She smiles. He smiles.
BOND
Well then you’ve come to the right 
place.
I/E. MAIN HOUSE - BOND'S HOUSE - NIGHT 71 71
Bond and Nomi pull up on the scooter.
BOND
After you.
Bond picks up a bottle of rum.
NOMI
Nice house.
BOND
Thank you.
Bond pours two large rums with ice, turns to Nomi. She’s 
already walking down the breezeway to his bedroom.
NOMI
Is that the bedroom?
He leans to see her disappearing. Follows.
BOND
Yes it is.
INT. BEDROOM - BOND’S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER 72 72
It’s dark.                                                     34.
35.She turns, faces him flirtatiously, then, coming as a surprise, 
takes off a wig.
BOND
Well, that’s not the first thing I 
thought you’d take off, but -
She sits on the bed. Smiles. But frank now. Not flirty-
NOMI
(British accent)
Yeah, you seem like a man who’s 
gagging for some action, Mister Bond.
BOND
Shall we cut to the chase?
NOMI
I’m here as a professional courtesy.
BOND
Well you’re not very courteous are 
you? You’ve broken my car. It’s 
Commander Bond, you know that.
(then)
Double-O?
NOMI
Two years.
BOND
Very young.
NOMI
High achiever.
BOND
Jesus Christ.
NOMI
The world’s moved on since you 
retired, Commander Bond, perhaps you 
didn’t notice.
BOND
No can’t say I had. And in my humble 
opinion, the world doesn’t change very 
much.                                                     35.
36.NOMI
You would say that. This all seems 
like heaven, this little bubble or 
whatever, but it’s so obvious 
you’re a man who only has time to 
kill... and nothing to live for.
(then)
So Valdo Obruchev is off limits. 
You get in my way I will put a 
bullet in your knee.
(evaluating)
The one that works.
BOND
You need to ask yourself a few more 
questions. MI6... CIA. Chasing 
after the same man and not 
communicating with each other? 
That’s not good. You know what, 
tell M hello. But I don’t work for 
him anymore.
NOMI
Tell him yourself.
She throws him her phone.
NOMI(CONT'D)
By the way I’m not just any old 
double-O, I’m 007.
This stings.
NOMI(CONT'D)
You probably thought they’d retire 
it.
She wants a reaction from him -
BOND
It’s just a number.
Got him -
NOMI
Huh. Yeah.
(betting)
See you in Cuba?
INT. Q’S LAB - DAY 73 73
The DB003 is visible in the wind tunnel.                                                     36.
37.M and Tanner watch as Q analyses the hard drive from 
Obruchev’s computer which is plugged into Q’s laptop.
M
How’s it going Q?
Q
Several large files seemed to have 
been wiped from Obruchev’s hard 
drive. He was working on some 
pretty advanced -
M
Can you retrieve the files?
Q
Trying.
M
Get me everything you can, then 
destroy the drive.
Q is taken aback.
Q
If I knew more about what this was 
I could -
M
Thank you Q. That’s all.
Q looks a bit put out.
Tanner interrupts holding up his phone. M’s phone rings too.
TANNER
The PM is calling again.
M
007. Tell them something, anything.
M picks up the call, expecting Nomi’s voice.
M(CONT'D)
007.
BOND (O.S.)
- M, darling. Couple of things.
M is shocked. Covers his mouth as he steps away from Q and 
Tanner.
M
Bond.                                                     37.
38.I/E. BOND’S HOUSE - MORNING 74 74
Bond on the phone, pacing.
BOND
I met your new 007. She’s a 
disarming young woman. So, Obruchev 
- you kept him on the payroll 
didn’t you?
M
Stay out of it. This has nothing to 
do with you.
BOND
It does. It’s Spectre.
(beat)
Mallory. What have you done?
INT. Q’S LAB - DAY 75 75
M doesn’t say anything. He hangs up. Stares at the phone. 
Tanner looks up.
TANNER
Double-O trouble?
M
The CIA have the advantage. Get me 
Blofeld.
TANNER
Sir? He only speaks to his 
psychiatrist.
M
(stern, to Q)
I know. The live feed is what I 
want.
Q nods. Loads up a live feed to Blofeld’s cell. It’s close 
enough to make out his passive face, rambling unpunctuated 
and apparently incoherent paragraphs to himself.
TANNER
He’s like this everyday. Mad as a 
bag of bees.
M
Good.
M is satisfied. It can’t be Blofeld behind all of this.                                                     38.
39.Tanner looks to Q obviously it’s something.
Q
What is it?
M
It’s nothing.
M walks off. Tanner follows him.
EXT. BOND’S HOUSE - DAY 76 76
Bond stands looking out to sea. He takes out his phone and 
makes a call.
BOND
Felix, I’m in.
FELIX (O.S.)
(laughs)
He’s in! There’s a young lady in 
Santiago I want you to meet.
EXT. HAPPENSTANCE AT SEA - LATE AFTERNOON 77 77
MEDIUM ON BOND, sails towards Cuba. Determination in his 
eyes, a bit of a thrill perhaps...beats fishing.
EXT. COAST OF SANTIAGO DE CUBA - LATE AFTERNOON 78 78
WIDE AERIAL ON Happenstance approaching the mouth of the bay. 
The imposing Castillo del Morro looms over it.
Suddenly A SEAPLANE drops into frame.
EXT. HAPPENSTANCE AT SEA - LATE AFTERNOON 79 79
Bond looks back and sees the plane roar over head, he knows 
it’s Nomi.
EXT. DOCK, SANTIAGO HARBOUR - DUSK 80 80
Happenstance is tied to the dock as MILITARY PORT AUTHORITY 
PERSONNEL check the boat for contraband.
A MILITARY POLICE OFFICER hands Bond’s documents back to him 
as Bond clocks the seaplane moored to the next wharf.
Nomi emerges from the seaplane. She gives Bond a little wave.                                                     39.
40.EXT. STREETS, SANTIAGO DE CUBA - DUSK 81 81
MUSIC echoes from store fronts. PEOPLE hustle.
Bond appears, spots something, an open air corner bar.
INT. CORNER BAR - SANTIAGO DE CUBA - TWILIGHT 82 82
Bond sees a woman in an elegant BLUE DRESS leaning against 
the counter sipping a drink: PALOMA.
Bond approaches, ready for flirtatious banter. She looks up --
BOND
Paloma?
PALOMA
You’re late. Vamos.
She motions for Bond to follow.
BOND
Something about a hat -- Paris --
PALOMA
-- What hat? Oh. El codigo. Si Si. 
I forget things when I get nervous. 
This is the biggest job I’ve ever 
had.
Bond looks at her, unsure of the tone of her humour.
INT. WINE CELLAR - SANTIAGO BUILDING - NIGHT 83 83
Paloma stops at a wine cellar. She takes out a key, nerves 
still have her shaking as she unlocks the door.
BOND
This your room?
PALOMA
(clearly it’s not)
It’s a wine cellar. Okay, come 
here.
She starts undoing his shirt.
BOND
Don’t you think we ought to get to 
know each other just a little 
before we...                                                     40.
41.PALOMA
Oh! No, no, no, no. I’m sorry.
She steps back, unrolls a suit bag she had stowed. It’s a 
tuxedo. He smiles.
BOND
Alright.
PALOMA
You do it.
BOND
Do you mind...
(signals for her to turn 
away)
She turns her back. Bond starts to undress.
BOND(CONT'D)
This is going to go brilliantly.
PALOMA
I know. 
(smiling)
I’ve done three weeks training.
EXT. STREETS, SANTIAGO DE CUBA - NIGHT 84 84
Bond and Paloma cross the street.
INT. EL NIDO - SANTIAGO DE CUBA - NIGHT 85 85
Bond and Paloma enter, dressed to kill, cross to a bar. He 
notices AN ENTRANCE flanked by DOORMEN under a grand 
stairway.
PALOMA
Okay?
BOND
Let’s get a drink.
PALOMA
Good idea.
They walk to the bar.
BOND
(to barman)
Two vodka martinis, shaken, not 
stirred.                                                     41.
42.Paloma takes a lipstick from her handbag, opens it and shakes 
out some objects into her hand. She flirtatiously inserts an 
earpiece in Bond’s ear.
PALOMA
So I can hear you.
She place an earpiece in her own ear. The drinks land. 
Perfectly iced and breathing.
BOND
What shall we drink to?
PALOMA
Felix?
BOND
To Felix.
(they clink glasses)
Remind me to get him a cigar.
They drink.
PALOMA
Vamos?
BOND
Sure.
They leave the bar.
INT. SMALL ROOM, EL NIDO - NIGHT 86 86
Valdo sweats nervously as he works on the briefcase computer 
we saw him bring from C-Minus-Two. PRIMO (wearing dark 
shades) watches him. 
A transparent specimen bag with Bond’s TOOTH BRUSH lies next 
to a portable DNA sequencer attached to the computer with a 
swab plate inserted.
PRIMO
Will this sample be enough for you?
VALDO
If he has used it, yes. It is now 
progressing.
A graphic on screen reads SEQUENCING COMPLETE as a new GENE 
CODE file named JB is created.                                                      42.
43.He then inserts a vial of Heracles in a slot in the 
briefcase, it is sucked in and we see a prompt for: SINGLE 
PROFILE or MULTIPLE PROFILES. Valdo drops a USB on the floor.
VALDO(CONT'D)
Oops! Sorry. Terrible, terrible 
gloves, so slippery.
He bends down but doesn’t pick it up. Instead he puts his 
foot over it and slips out from his sock the USB he swallowed 
in the lab.
VALDO(CONT'D)
Forgive me.
PRIMO
How much longer?
Valdo SECRETLY TRANSFERS MULTIPLE RECORDS into the TARGET 
GENE CODE prompt. He presses enter.
VALDO
Ah! To happy new future for Spectre.
The case beeps: GENE ENCODING COMPLETE. WEAPONIZED.
VALDO(CONT'D)
Now it is ready.
He hands Primo the vial of Heracles. Primo places the vial 
inside a protective cover and leaves.
INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER 87 87
UPSTAIRS, Primo opens a cupboard, places the vial inside and 
turns a lever.
DOWNSTAIRS, Paloma and Bond enter. A BRASS BAND, driven by an 
energetic CONDUCTOR, pumps music into the room. This party is 
huge.
BOND
You go that way, I’ll go this way.
Paloma and Bond part. (THEY’LL SPEAK ON COMMS UNTIL THEY 
RECONNECT).
Bond surveys. He’s in the thick of dwarfs, pregnant women, 
wild cats and revellers dancing with religious fervour. 
BOND (ON COMMS)(CONT'D)
What is this? Spectre bonga-bonga? 
You ever been to a party like this?                                                     43.
44.PALOMA (ON COMMS)
How do you think I got this job?
BOND (ON COMMS)
Don’t get distracted now. Remember 
we’re looking for our Russian 
scientist.
Then Bond hones in on the BIGWIGS of the party. OLDER MEN 
with lots of YOUNGER WOMEN shoulder shimmying.
PALOMA (ON COMMS)
I’m seeing a lot of Spectre agents.
People turn an look at Bond, smiling with creepy and uncanny 
consistency.
BOND
Yes and it looks like all of them.
Bond spots Primo on the stairs with a BODYBUARD.
PALOMA (ON COMMS)
Friend of yours?
BOND
Cyclops. We ran into each other in 
Italy. That was an eye-opening 
experience.
Bond notices something -
BOND(CONT'D)
They’re wearing earpieces.
PALOMA
Scanning.
Paloma adjusts her hidden earpiece, dialling through 
frequencies.
INT. DANCE HALL, EL NIDO - CONTINUOUS 88 88
GUARDS with the BLOFELD EYEBALL enter, heading towards the 
centre stage.
Paloma finishes scanning.
PALOMA
Found it.
As we tune into a familiar VOICE:                                                     44.
45.BLOFELD (V.O.)
Celebrate me... my birthday.
Bond and Paloma walk the perimeter of the room.
PALOMA
Who’s the birthday boy?
BOND
Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
PALOMA
He’s here?
Bond looks around, how can Blofeld be “seeing”?
BOND
No. He’s in London. In prison.
Bond approaches the eyeball -- then --
PALOMA (ON COMMS)
How do you know for sure?
-- Bond looks at it. DOES HE SEE ME?
BOND
Because I put him there.
BLOFELD (V.O.)
...experience a delicious 
surprise...
Paloma looks up, sees Valdo Obruchev watching the party from 
its edges lustily.
PALOMA
I’ve spotted him. Our little 
Russian scientist.
BOND
Have you got him?
She tracks back to the edge of the room to watch Valdo 
Obruchev approach the dance hall from upstairs.
PALOMA
I got him.
BOND (ON COMMS)
Stay with him.                                                     45.
46.BLOFELD (V.O.)
...I see with my little eye...my 
Little eye says hi..Here’s to the 
end of our Pariah... 
Primo looks at Bond, almost as if he knew he’d be there. 
Smiles.
BLOFELD (V.O.)
My burden, my brother, JAMES BOND.
Suddenly the room goes DARK. THREE SPOTLIGHTS shine onto 
Bond.
BLOFELD (V.O.)
Goodbye James.
As if on cue the BAND’S MUSIC becomes a DRUM ROLL.
Primo and EVERY SPECTRE AGENT in the room step away from 
Bond, forming a circle around him.
PALOMA
Coño! You’re popular tonight.
BLOFELD (V.O.)
You can’t run. It’s too late.
A mist cascades down onto him. The crowd watches eagerly.
Bond looks at the mist falling around him, expecting it to 
mean death. But nothing happens. At first there is some 
confusion.
BLOFELD (V.O.)
It’s already crawling under your 
skin.
(to Spectre agents)
Don’t be alarmed. It’s harmless to 
us. Just to him. So delicious!
A WOMAN screams.
Bond turns. It’s hard to see in the swinging and panning 
light of the spotlights, but we see horrific glimpses.
A SPECTRE AGENT collapses to the ground, writhing.
Then ANOTHER.
THEN GROUPS OF THEM.                                                     46.
47.Their skin turns BLOTCHY RED and their lips and eyelids 
BLISTER as they fall to the floor, blood trickling from their 
eyes, ears and noses.
THEN ALL SPECTRE AGENTS fall, experiencing the gruesome 
effects.
PRIMO AND THE BODYGUARDS ARE NOT AFFECTED. They see their 
masters dying and are at first frozen. Some try to 
resuscitate them.
Valdo Obruchev, watching it all, is rapt with excitement --
VALDO
It is working. It is working! Only 
Spectre are dying.
(he sees Paloma)
Hello. You are my...escort?
Valdo looks at Paloma. Realises she was not sent by Safin.
VALDO(CONT'D)
No? Oh.
He tries to run. Bond spots him and yells to Paloma.
BOND
Go!
Bond jumps over the dead bodies. Grabs a drink off a tray, 
throwing the tray like a weapon, knocking Valdo in the back 
of the head. Bond downs the drink, tosses away the glass and 
goes after Valdo.
Valdo hits the ground, reaches for his USB dongle, tries to 
swallow it. He goes to stand up.
Paloma kicks him back down. Valdo drops the dongle.
BOND(CONT'D)
Thank you. I’ll take this.
Bond grabs the USB dongle.
PALOMA
What was that?
BODYGUARDS open fire on Bond, Paloma and Valdo. Bond and 
Paloma fire back. 
ON PRIMO recovering in the DANCE HALL. He finds the Blofeld 
eye, puts it back in.                                                     47.
48.By the exit, Bond and Paloma grab Valdo and shoot their way 
out of the party.
BOND
Time to go. Let’s go!
Valdo, gripping his briefcase, alternates between elation at 
the success of the experiment and terror as bullets ricochet 
around him.
INT. EL NIDO BAR - CONTINUOUS 89 89
Bond watches their rear while Paloma guides Valdo with a gun 
to his back.
They move through the doors of the party to the El Nido bar, 
B-lining it to the entrance.
A car skids in front of their exit. Opens fire. Paloma 
returns fire and pushes Valdo down for cover. Bond takes down 
the driver of the car.
PALOMA
Clear!
SUDDENLY NOMI comes crashing through the glass domed roof on 
a cable.
Bond, Paloma and Valdo shelter from the glass.
Nomi lands in between them, grabs Valdo, clips a belt around 
him. She looks at Bond.
NOMI
May I cut in?
Nomi and Valdo fly up through the ceiling as Bond dodges more 
Spectre gunfire.
Bond shoots one down, rushing at him. His submachine gun 
slides towards him.
Bond throws the submachine gun to Paloma. She smiles.
PALOMA
Go get him. I’ll hold them off.
Bond runs up the stairs, jumping from the landing to the 
mezzanine, while Paloma engages the bodyguards below.                                                     48.
49.Bond sees Nomi and Valdo through the skylight as she fires 
one bolt from her harpoon device into the masonry of the El 
Nido building and then another into the theatre across the 
street.
PALOMA (ON COMMS)(CONT'D)
Have you got them?
BOND (ON COMMS)
Nearly.
WE TRACK behind Nomi as she jumps and zips across the street 
and end up on a CU of the first BOLT she fired into the 
masonry.
Suddenly it starts to be hit by bullets, by BOND --
-- Below Bond fires at it, the anchor breaks loose and -
From the roof across the street we see Nomi drop onto a 
balcony below, slamming with Valdo into a wall of bricks,
Bond skids onto the mezzanine balcony of El Nido. Sees Nomi 
stand, brain battered.
INT. EL NIDO - CONTINUOUS 90 90
IN THE STAIRWELL, WE SEE PALOMA, out of ammo, hiding from 
more SPECTRE entering the bar. Some head up the stairs 
towards BOND.
ON THE THEATRE BALCONY, Nomi holds Valdo down as they duck 
for cover. The balcony balustrade is annihilated by bullet 
fire.
BOND (ON COMMS)
Paloma, I know you’re busy but the 
curtain’s about to come down on 
this one.
PALOMA (ON COMMS)
I can get a car. Where do you need 
it?
BOND
I’ll be right there.
ON THE GROUND FLOOR of the El Nido, Paloma engages in hand to 
hand combat with SPECTRE.                                                     49.
50.ON THE EL NIDO MEZZANINE Bond takes down two BODYGUARDS. They 
smash through the shutters and crush the mezzanine handrail, 
falling to the bar area below just as Paloma finishes off her 
BODYGUARDS.
Nomi returns fire from Spectre Guards.
Paloma looks for Bond. He’s covered in broken bottles. Finds 
an unbroken one, stands up with it, dazed.
She goes to the bar. They are both adrenalised; look a sexy 
mess. Bond pours them drinks.
BOND(CONT'D)
Three weeks training, really?
PALOMA
More or less.
BOND
Still gonna need that car. Salut!
PALOMA
Salut!
They clink glasses and knock back their drinks. Paloma takes 
a breath and splits. Bond heads back to the street.
EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS 91 91
Bond takes out BODYGUARDS shooting at Nomi as he runs across  
the road towards her. 
VALDO
Where are you taking me?
NOMI
I’m taking you back to Mother, 
darling.
VALDO
Mother? Oh no, no, no, no.
While Nomi is taking fire Valdo sneaks onto the scaffolding. 
Paloma, in a car now, sees her opportunity. 
PALOMA
There you are!
She guns it, heading straight for the scaffolding, past Bond, 
and crashes into it.                                                     50.
51.Valdo crashes down onto the car. Bond approaches.
BOND
Stay there!
(to Paloma)
You okay?
PALOMA
I’m great!
Paloma looks up. Success. She sees a cigar rolling on the 
seat. She grabs it.
Nomi, stuck above, can’t do anything but watch as Bond drags 
Valdo away with Paloma leading their way.
BOND
(to Nomi)
I’m gonna borrow your plane, sorry.
EXT. BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS 92 92
Paloma unlocks the door and turns to Valdo and Bond.
PALOMA
It’s a short cut.
Bond drags Valdo inside.
EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS 93 93
THREE POLICE CARS appear. They see Nomi on the balcony and draw 
their weapons. 
Nomi shoots at an electric pole. It falls, dragging down a nest 
of wires causing a chain reaction.
She disappears in a shower of sparks cascading around the 
vehicles.
INT. BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS 94 94
Paloma opens a door leading to an alleyway.
PALOMA
This is my stop. Goodbye.
Bond shakes her hand.
BOND
You were excellent.                                                     51.
52.PALOMA
You too. Next time stay longer.
BOND
I will.
PALOMA
Hey! Cigar for Felix.
She hands him a cigar in a metal tube. Smiles.
BOND
Thank you.
(to Valdo)
Come on.
PALOMA
Ciao.
BOND
Ciao.
Bond and Valdo disappear into the alleyway.
EXT. DOCK, SANTIAGO HARBOUR - NIGHT 95 95
Bond and Valdo run towards the plane docked at the deserted 
quay. The sea plane is straining at the ropes.
BOND
Come on, let’s go.
VALDO
No, no, no sir, I’m not getting on 
that.
Bond throws Valdo’s briefcase onboard.
BOND
Well that’s a shame because we 
don’t have a choice. Let’s go. Come 
on.
Bond pushes Valdo onto the plane.
I/E. SEA PLANE - SAME 96 96
Valdo is white knuckled as Bond pilots the plane.
BOND
Okay, okay. What have we got here?                                                     52.
53.Bond starts the engines, throttling forward.
VALDO
Sir, I just saved your life. Please 
remember that. So could you please 
tell me what the hell is going on
Where are you taking me?
BOND
Somewhere safe.
Bond clears a cloud. A dark shape looms on the crest of a 
swell, the silhouette of a FISH TRAWLER.
Bond circles as he looks for confirmation from deck.
I/E. SEA PLANE/TRAWLER - LATER 97 97
As the plane nears the rear of the trawler, BOND cuts the 
engine, letting the current drift them into the bow.
EXT. TRAWLER DECK - MOMENTS LATER 98 98
Valdo boards, then Bond. Felix and Ash exit the cabin onto 
the deck.
FELIX
(laughing)
At least make it look hard.
Bond pushes Valdo past Felix and Ash towards the cabin.
BOND
Thanks Felix. You walked me into a 
trap.
Felix’s smile drops. This isn’t what he expected either.
INT. TRAWLER CABIN - MOMENTS LATER 99 99
Bond pushes Valdo in. Felix and Ash follow.
FELIX
What trap?
BOND
Spectre is dead.
(to Valdo)
Sit!                                                     53.
54.FELIX
Who’s dead?
BOND
All of them.
FELIX
Good.
Valdo sits, terrified. Bond throws the case onto the table. 
He opens it.
BOND
What is this? Explain it to me.
VALDO
I don’t have the words to describe 
to someone like you.
BOND
Try one.
Ash comes over.
VALDO
It’s... Perfect.
BOND
A perfect what?
VALDO
Assassin.
Ash and Felix look at each other.
ASH
Thank you Bond, your mission is 
done. We can take it from here.
BOND
Why didn’t it kill me?
ASH
You don’t have to answer those 
questions. Bond...
BOND
Why Spectre?
ASH
Bond, please stop asking...
BOND
QUIET!                                                     54.
55.FELIX
(to Valdo)
Speak up.
VALDO
Because you were never the intended 
target.
FELIX
He was a target, why?
VALDO
I changed the DNA like we decided 
and now the plan is complete and...
BOND
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who is we?
ASH
(to Felix)
He is not allowed to do this.
BOND
Did M make you build this?
ASH
He is out of line here Felix.
FELIX
Ash...
BOND
Did M order you to kill Spectre.
ASH
Don’t answer that.
BOND
Is M behind this?
ASH
HE IS OUT OF LINE.
BOND
FELIX.
FELIX
ASH, SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
VALDO
M helped me build it, but please he 
does not have the vision...                                                     55.
56.BOND
Well who does?
VALDO
...for how to use it.
BOND
Who does? Blofeld? How did he know 
I was going to be there?
Valdo looks over Bond’s shoulder. Bond turns round.
Ash pulls his gun, Felix sees it and intercepts it. Ash fires 
into Felix’s chest. Felix looks down at the wound. It’s bad. 
He collapses down into the engine room below.
Valdo shuts the briefcase.
Bond turns to Ash. They break into a brutal fight.
-- A terrified Valdo in the middle of the mayhem. He sees 
Ash’s gun on the floor, kicks it towards Ash.
-- Ash retrieve his gun and fires at Bond who has no choice 
but to take cover by diving down into the engine room.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 100 100
Bond hits the floor hard as Ash barricades the door above.
INT. TRAWLER CABIN - CONTINUOUS 101 101
Ash turns to Valdo.
ASH
I’m with Safin, you understand?
VALDO
Yes. I am Doctor Obruchev.
ASH
I know who you are.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 102 102
Bond watches the door slam shut. Felix holds his wound.
FELIX
I don’t know about you but I get a 
feeling in my gut Ash might not be on 
our side.                                                     56.
57.BOND
We need to have a conversation about 
the company you keep.
FELIX
I’m with you.
Bond takes off his jacket, uses it to stem Felix’s wound.
BOND
That’s a lot of blood.
EXT. THE HULL - CONTINUOUS 103 103
Ash sets charges against the hull of the trawler.
VALDO
So, where are we going?
ASH
Get in the plane Doctor.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 104 104
Bond tries to stem the blood from Felix’s wound.
FELIX
This might be my last mission.
(looks up at Bond)
What do you think?
BOND
I think you’re just looking for an 
excuse not to help me. Paloma, she 
gave me a cigar for you and you are 
going to smoke it.
FELIX
Nice but maybe you should hold on to 
that for now.
BOND
You just stay put. Keep the pressure 
on that. I’m gonna find us a way out.
Bond gets up and goes towards the stairs.
FELIX
I’ll be over here.
Bond turns back to Felix.                                                     57.
58.BOND
You know Felix, we’ve really need 
to stop meeting...
And suddenly -- BOOM --
A shock blasts through the hold so strongly the steel walls 
RIPPLE.
Felix is rocked by the explosion and submerged in the water. 
Bond is sent crashing to the ground.
EXT. SEA - TRAWLER - PRE-DAWN 105 105
The sea plan lifts into the air as a giant fireball 
illuminates the night sky.
The trawler starts to roll over on its side as the stern has 
been completely blown off.
INT. SEA PLANE - NIGHT 106 106
Ash pilots the plane with Valdo in the back.
ASH
I was such a big fan of his.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 107 107
Bond is knocked out on the ground. Blood drips from his ears.
He sits up groggy, brain battered. Can’t see Felix.
BOND
Felix!
Bond dives into the deeper water in the engine room. Finds 
Felix, pulls him out. Felix coughs, looks around.
FELIX
This doesn’t look good.
Bond is holding him up as the water floods in.
BOND
Come on Felix. We’ve been in worse 
than this. Let’s go!
FELIX
It’s like back when I was a kid on 
that shrimper...                                                     58.
59.BOND
You’re from Milwaukee.
Felix smiles. A life lived lying.
FELIX
Am I? I thought I made that up.
Bond starts pulling him towards the front of the trawler.
EXT. SEA - NIGHT 108 108
The trawler is on fire and sinking fast.
INT. ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 109 109
Bond is dragging Felix through the water as the trawler 
sinks.
FELIX
Just let me go. Let me go.
Felix has a moment of delirium.
BOND
No!
The room pivots further, turning over almost upside down as 
it starts to sink stern down.
Felix grabs him tight --
FELIX
You got this?
Bond nods.
BOND
Yeah.
FELIX
Make it worth it.
Felix smiles as he fades.
FELIX(CONT'D)
James. It’s a good life isn’t it?
Beat. Bond looks at his fellow agent. Dying in action.
BOND
The best. Felix.                                                     59.
60.Felix is gone. 
BOND(CONT'D)
Felix. Felix.
Bond lets him sink into the room.
The trawler GROANS. It’s going to sink fast.
Bond has to dive towards a forward hold.
Underwater, he sees a hatch. He tries to open it, using his 
legs for leverage. It’s stuck tight.
He rises up for the last bit of air left in the hold. Dives 
back down. Grabs the circular handle, using all his force...
CUT TO:
EXT. TRAWLER - CONTINUOUS 110 110
The trawler is vertical now and slipping below the surface.
INT. FORWARD HOLD - CONTINUOUS 111 111
Bond swims to the surface.
EXT. SEA - CONTINUOUS 112 112
Bond emerges and gasps for breath.
Among the floating debris he sees something bobbing in the 
water. He swims towards it.
It’s an emergency raft.
EXT. SEA - DAY 113 113
Hours later. Bond sits with Felix’s cigar, still intact in 
its metal tube. A reminder of what needs to be done.
A large CMA CGM container ship spots Bond’s raft in the water 
and approaches.
EXT. BOND’S LOCK-UP - DAY 114 114
Bond (in windbreaker) lifts a sliding garage door to his lock  
up.                                                      60.
61.INT. BOND’S LOCK UP - CONTINUOUS 115 115
Bond enters and pulls off a dust sheet, revealing the V8  
Vantage. 
EXT. BOND’S LOCK UP - DAY 116 116
The Vantage squeals out of his lockup. He’s back.
EXT. LONDON - DAY 117 117
Establishing shot of the London skyline. 
EXT. MI6 - DAY 118 118
Bond steps out of the Vantage dressed in a sharp suit. He 
walks up to the front of the Ministry of Defence’s art deco 
facade.
INT. MI6 - LOBBY - DAY 119 119
Bond goes to the security desk.
GUARD
Name.
BOND
Bond. James Bond. 
Guard looks at him confused. Who?
INT. MI6 - MAIN FLOOR - DAY 120 120
BOND walks down the centre of the room wearing a visitor’s pass 
with Moneypenny. Other agents and analysts notice him.
MONEYPENNY
How’s retirement?
BOND
(side eye)
(It was) Quiet.
Nomi happens to be in the main office. She is surprised to 
see him. She pivots and joins them as they walk.
NOMI
Hi. Where’s Obruchev?                                                     61.
62.Bond just looks at her: who?
MONEYPENNY
I thought you two would get along.
They walk together. 
A WOMAN approaches, hands Nomi a document.
WOMAN
Report, 007.
NOMI
Thank you.
A WOMAN walks past, sees the two  of them.
WOMAN
(to Nomi)
007.
NOMI
(to Bond)
That must bother you.
They arrive outside M’s office.
NOMI(CONT'D)
Where is he?
BOND
He left me for somebody else.
NOMI
So, you lost him?
Moneypenny talks into the phone.
MONEYPENNY
You can go in.
BOND
Thank you.NOMI
Thank you.
Bond and Nomi share a brief look as Bond enters. Nomi goes to 
join him.
MONEYPENNY
(to Nomi)
Alone, I’m afraid.
BOND
Does that bother you?                                                     62.
63.Bond shuts the door in Nomi’s face. Nomi and Moneypenny look 
at each other, alone in the reception.
NOMI
I get why you shot him.
MONEYPENNY
Yes, well. Everyone tries at least 
once.
INT. M’S OFFICE, MI6 - DAY 121 121
Bond sits in M’s office. M stands at his desk. They stare at 
each other. Bond cocks his head curiously. 
Pause.
BOND
(light)
Has your desk got bigger or have 
you got smaller?
M looks at him.
M
I can’t pretend there weren’t some 
sorry faces when you left us, Bond. 
But you fell so far off the grid 
that we thought you must be dead.
M pours himself a drink. Bond registers this. Unusual.
M(CONT'D)
Now learning that you were in fact 
alive and well, working for the 
CIA, well that really was a blow.
BOND
Well, they just asked so nicely.
M
It’s a shame that you haven’t lost 
your touch. We wouldn’t be in this 
mess.
BOND
This is your mess.
M looks at him sharply.
Beat.                                                     63.
64.BOND(CONT'D)
Blofeld tried to kill me in Cuba. 
But someone hijacked his plan and 
whoever stole your weapon used it 
to wipe out Spectre instead. Now 
your weapon is on the run and 
nobody seems to know who has it. So 
you can imagine why I’ve come back 
to play.
M is steely.
M
We’re looking into it.
BOND
I can identify the man that took 
Obruchev.
M
And what do you want in return, 
Bond?
Beat.
BOND
Blofeld.
M frowns.
M
Impossible. He’s in Belmarsh.
BOND
Yes, he ran a Spectre meeting in 
Cuba from Belmarsh.
M
How? How?
Pause.
M(CONT'D)
No-one has access. No-one.
BOND
Why didn’t you shut it down? Why 
didn’t you shut Heracles down?
M
I answer to the interests of my 
country. Not you.                                                     64.

And to Felix Leiter?
M
I certainly don’t answer to Felix 
Leiter.
BOND
Perhaps because he’s dead?
Beat. M feels the impact. He drinks. He can see Bond is 
moved.
M
(regretfully)
I’m sorry. I had a lot of respect 
for Leiter.
Bond just looks at him.
M(CONT'D)
Look, if you have information, I’d 
be happy to receive it.
BOND
Get me into Belmarsh.
M
No. Blofeld’s the only member of 
Spectre still breathing, I can’t 
risk that.
BOND
Oh but you will risk developing a 
DNA targeting weapon with a corrupt 
scientist for ten years.
M pours another drink
M
There was nothing to suggest that 
Obruchev was working for anyone 
else. I had him...
BOND
My God! You’re thirsty at the 
moment -
M flips suddenly. Interrupting. It should be shocking. He’s 
not in a good place! Bond stays calm.
M
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK TO ME 
THAT WAY.

INSINUATIONS ABOUT MY JUDGMENT. IF 
YOU HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE, YOU 
ARE IRRELEVANT. YOU’VE DONE YOUR 
BIT AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
SERVICE. AGAIN. GOODBYE.
He buzzes his intercom.
M(CONT'D)
Moneypenny, send 007 in please. You 
can go Bond.
Bond stands. He looks at M. Then at the desk.
BOND
(throwaway)
It’s definitely the same desk.
Bond exits past Nomi, who is entering. 
BOND(CONT'D)
Thank you.
The door closes behind him. As Bond passes Moneypenny, he 
throws his visitor’s pass in the bin.
They are alone. She can sense M’s frustration.
M
Go to Belmarsh. I want everything 
that Blofeld listens to, looks at 
and touches scanned. Scan every 
corner of that cell. Scan the whole 
prison, in fact scan the whole damn 
man.
NOMI
Sir. I’ll bring my gloves. 
INT. MI6 - ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER 122 122

He turns. Moneypenny has followed him. She looks serious. 
Then...
MONEYPENNY(CONT'D)
What are you doing for dinner?M (CONT'D)                                                     66.

INT. Q’S FLAT - KITCHEN - EVENING 123 123
Q is happily, but nervously preparing dinner in his flat. He 
has lit a couple of candles. The table looks romantic. His 
door bell goes - he looks at the clock. Bit early. He dusts 
himself off and goes to the door.
INT. Q’S FLAT - FRONT DOOR - EVENING 124 124
Q, excited, looks at the CCTV screen and immediately 
deflates. Bond stands with Moneypenny at the door. Q presses 
the entry button.
Q opens the door. Bond and Moneypenny stand there.
Q
So you’re not dead!
Bond walks in.
BOND
Hello Q. I’ve missed you.
Followed by Moneypenny.
MONEYPENNY
Mmmm. That smells great.
Bond sees the table, picks up a bottle of wine.
BOND
Were you expecting somebody?
INT. Q'S FLAT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 125 125
Bond, Moneypenny and Q enter the kitchen.
Q
Excuse me. This is the first time 
I’ve - he’ll be here in twenty 
minutes. I can’t take my focus off

BOND
I need you to tell me what’s on 
that.
He holds up the USB.                                                     67.
68.Q
No. I need to lay the table.
Q removes a hairless cat from the table.
BOND
You know they come with fur these 
days?
Q
I want to be very clear that I am 
not authorised to help you and I 
have sworn a -
MONEYPENNY
It’s to do with Heracles.
Beat. Q pays attention. They have clearly talked about this.
Q
I presume M doesn’t know that this 
is happening.
MONEYPENNY
No. But there’s something going on 
Q. We need to find out what it is.
Q checks his watch, lets out a breath.
Q
It’s never nine to five is it.
He takes the dongle.
BOND
Thank you.
Q is about to insert the USB into his laptop when he stops 
himself.
Q
Er...Bond...
BOND
Yes.
Q
Do you know where this has been?
BOND
Everywhere I should imagine.
Q
Into the sandbox.                                                     68.
69.INT. ELSEWHERE IN Q’S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER 126 126
Q is at a different (more secure) computer. The USB plugged 
in. 
Bond pours some wine for Moneypenny who is looking at Q’s 
stuff.
MONEYPENNY
Thank you.
The decryption of several files begins.
Q
It’s a database.
(to Moneypenny)
Don’t touch that please.
BOND
What’s the data?
Q
It’s DNA. Multiple individuals. 
What was M working on?
BOND
Something he should have shut down 
years ago.
On the computer screen: HIDDEN FILES DETECTED.
Q
Oh hello!
BOND
What?
Q
There’s more. Hidden files. I was 
asked to recover what I could from 
Obruchev’s hard-drive just after 
the explosion. And I have a pretty 
good feeling that this...
He brings up the information he’d been working on. It links 
with what is on the USB.
Q(CONT'D)
Is what was missing.
The DNA records on the USB begin to auto-match with DNA 
records from MI6 databases.                                                     69.
70.Q(CONT'D)
Yeah. A complete disc.
Q clicks. A series of names from MI6 records come up. Each of 
them marked ‘Deceased’.
Q(CONT'D)
So Obruchev is working for someone 
who managed to kill all of Spectre.
Bond points at the screen.
BOND
Not all of them.
Reveal of the screen. There is a single record not marked 
‘Deceased’ accompanied by a picture of BLOFELD.
MONEYPENNY
Blofeld.
Beat. They register what this means.
BOND
(to Q)
Can you show me the other files?
The decryption of Obruchev’s other files has completed. Q 
clicks on the screen. Suddenly reams and reams of names 
appear and keep appearing. The volume is frightening.
Q
Wait. This can’t just be Spectre. 
Oh my God! There are thousands.
BOND
Who are they?
Q
They’re in categories - I’m going 
to need more time to organi-
MONEYPENNY
There have been computer breaches 
round the world of databases 
holding DNA information. We’ve been 
tracking them.
BOND
Ours?
MONEYPENNY
I can’t imagine they’re leaving us 
out. Whoever they are.                                                     70.
71.BOND
Blofeld will know who they are. Q, 
you need to get me into Belmarsh.
MONEYPENNY
Well, there’s only one person he’ll 
speak to.
BOND
Who? M said no-one has access.
Q
Really?
MONEYPENNY
Did he?
BOND
What’s that?
They both look instantly awkward.
The oven timer rings.
Q
Can I just have one nice evening 
please before the world explodes.
BOND

Who has access?
Q looks at Moneypenny.

You can’t say that.

Madeleine enters the simple understated space.
MADELEINE
I’m sorry I’m late. I wasn’t 
expecting a new -
She looks at the new patient. Well dressed, with intelligent 
eyes and damaged facial skin.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Patient.
SAFIN
Sorry if I surprised you.
She sits. She is confident and direct, but warm.
MADELEINE
No, I like surprises.
SAFIN
You’re very attractive for a 
psychotherapist. Must be dangerous 
for your clients.
MADELEINE
They are usually more of a danger 
to themselves.
He looks at a bunch of foxgloves in a vase on her desk.
SAFIN
Foxgloves. Beautiful. Did you 
choose them?
MADELEINE
Yes, I find them friendly.                                                     72.
73.SAFIN
You know if you eat them, they can 
cause your heart to just - stop.
MADELEINE
Then I’ll make sure not to.
Beat.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Do you know a lot about flowers?
SAFIN
My father had a garden. He taught 
me. He died when I was young, but 
my interest... remained.
MADELEINE
It’s difficult to lose a parent. 
Especially at a young age.
SAFIN
Yes. Death has a particular effect 
on children, doesn’t it?
MADELEINE
What effect did it have on you?
SAFIN
Profound.
Uncomfortable pause as he looks at her. Especially her eyes.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
But I saved a life once. I think 
that had more of an effect.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Why is that?
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Saving someone’s life connects you 
to them forever. The same as taking 
it -- they belong to you.
Madeleine is sensing something is off.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
I’m not very good at talking about 
myself so I... I brought a memory 
box. I thought it might interest 
you.
Safin pushes a box towards her. She opens it as she talks...                                                     73.
74.MADELEINE
Sometimes objects can me more 
evocative than memories.
She looks inside. It’s the mask Safin was wearing from the 
opening sequence. Her breathing changes. She looks up at him.
SAFIN
I never forgot your eyes under the 
ice. They needed me. It is a shock 
to see them so many years later. 
They still need me. I am rather... 
taken by them.
MADELEINE
What do you want.
SAFIN
Just a favour. You owe me.
MADELEINE
You murdered my mother.
SAFIN
And your father killed my entire 
family.
(shrugs)
Parents.
He pulls out a bottle of perfume and places it on her desk.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
I need you to visit someone for me. 
Wearing this. It’s harmless to you. 
You are the only one who can do it.
MADELEINE
No. Why would I do anything for 
you?
SAFIN
Because I am a man willing to kill 
the person you love most.
MADELEINE
I have already lost everyone I have 
ever loved. There is nothing you 
can threaten me with.
SAFIN
That is very sad to hear 
Madeleine... But it is not true, is 
it?                                                     74.

Madeleine Swann? Really
M
Well yes, we took your information 
seriously, but that was five years 
ago. Nothing came up.
BOND
She’s very smart and very good at 
hiding things.
M
She’s a useful asset. She’s the only 
psychiatrist he agreed to speak to. I 
had to exercise my judgment.
BOND
Your judgement is the problem.
M can’t deny it.
M
That weapon was designed to save lives 
and to eradicate collateral damage for 
our agents. A clean, accurate shot, 
every time. But it had to be off the 
books. There are enough holes in our 
national security. If the world knows 
what this can do -
BOND 
They’d kill for it.
M
Look, if it’s an error, it’s on my 
shoulders. Fair and square. I’ve 
dedicated my life to defending this 
country. I believe in defending the 
principles of this...

Bond gives a little smile. M side-eyes him. He knows.

Oh for fuck’s sake! I see. And 
after Blofeld? What do they want?

Well it’s hard to say. I would 
imagine world leaders, innocent 
civilians, freedom. You know, that 
sort of thing.
M
Oh good! Just the usual.
BOND
Just the usual.
M can’t help but laugh a little. Bond does too.
M
Blofeld was communicating with his

MONEYPENNY
What are they?
Q
They’re nanobots.
TANNER
Right.
Q
Microscopic bio-robots that can 
enter your system by the slightest 
contact with your skin.
M
Programmed with DNA to target 
specific individuals. Heracles was 
designed to be the most efficient 
weapon in our arsenal. Passing 
through people harmlessly before 
reaching its intended target.
Q
But Obruchev modified the nanobots 
so that they can kill anyone 
related to the target.
NOMI
Anyone?
Q
Well since it’s DNA based, with 
further modifications, yes. 
Families, certain genetic traits. 
Single nucleotide variants and 
polymorphisms that could target a 
range from individuals to... whole 
ethnicities.

It’s not an ideal situation.
Blofeld’s cage appears in the distance, heads towards them. 
The security door opens.
Madeleine’s breathing is quickening. She sees Blofeld appear 
in his man-sized cage, wheeling towards them. The sight of 
him strikes her deeper than she anticipated.

Where are you going?
MADELEINE
Home.
The message hits him. The door closes. She’s gone. Why the 
message?
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 143 143
Tanner and Nomi watch.                                                     84.
85.NOMI
I’ll get her.
TANNER
Wait.
NOMI
He won’t talk without her.
TANNER
Just wait. Special delivery.
They see Blofeld’s cage arrive in the interrogation room.
INT. BELMARSH PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 144 144
Blofeld, head lolled slightly forward, watches Bond with 
satisfaction.
BLOFELD
James!
He smiles. He wasn’t in a good mood but given what he just 
witnessed, he’s in a happier mood. He still won’t speak --
Bond knows he won’t talk in principle, but attempts to appeal 
to him frankly.
BOND
Hello Blofeld. Perhaps you can help 
me. Cuba was quite the party - 
happy birthday by the way.
BLOFELD
Thank you.
BOND
I’m trying to piece together what 
happened. There you were - or here 
you were - with the world’s most 
powerful people, your friends, all 
in one room, a noose around my neck 
and your hands on the most valuable 
weapon in existence. It’s like a 
testimony to your greatness. A 
celebration of all that is Ernst 
Stavro Blofeld.
BLOFELD
Yes James.                                                     85.
86.BOND
But then it all went wrong, didn’t 
it?
BLOFELD
My sweet James. What do you want?
BOND
Your enemies are closing in 
Blofeld. And the biggest twist here 
is that if you tell me who they 
are, I could save your life.
BLOFELD
My avenging angel. My chaser of 
lost causes. And now you even chase 
mine. But you’re asking the wrong 
question. Yes, Cuba was a 
disappointment but we all cry on 
our birthday.
(beat)
You need to ask yourself... Why are 
WE here. 
INT. Q’S LAB - SAME 145 145
Q is scrubbing through surveillance, looking for Ash. There 
is footage from all over the world, entry points, offices, 
car parks etc.  Bond’s face appears on the screen.
Q
Looking smart Bond!
Q turns to grab a sweet from a drawer when there is a beep. 
He looks up. Suddenly the screen in front of him stops 
scrubbing. It focuses on one face. It zooms in and identifies 
someone... LOGAN ASH. He looks down and sees it’s the screen 
connected to Blofeld’s eyeball.
Q(CONT'D)
It’s him!
Q bolts upright in his chair. He grabs his phone to send a 
text.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME 146 146
Tanner and Nomi watch Bond and Blofeld.                                                     86.

You keep coming back to me. I 
thought I’d never see you again. 
But fate draws us back together.
Nomi receives a text on her phone.
NOMI
Yes! M’s got eyes on Logan Ash.
TANNER
Go.
NOMI
Let me know what happens.
She goes.
BLOFELD (O.S.)
Now your enemy is my enemy.
INT. BELMARSH PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME 147 147
Back with Bond and Blofeld.
BLOFELD
How did that happen?
BOND
Well, you live long enough...
BLOFELD
(laughs)
Yes. Look at us. Two old men in a 
hole trying to work out who’s 
playing tricks on us.
Blofeld grows weary of the subject. Decides to salt a wound 
instead.
BLOFELD(CONT'D)
She still loves you. Did you know 
that? And you broke her heart. And 
she betrayed you.
BOND
She’s irrelevant.
BLOFELD
Oh I wouldn’t be so quick to 
dismiss. You said it yourself... 
she’s very good at hiding things. 
(MORE)                                                     87.

out. And it will...
(smiling)
It will be the death of you.
BOND
A name. Just give me a name. 
BLOFELD
Madeleine.
BOND
Please. Please, no games.
BLOFELD
(sing song)
Madeleine.
(energised with the idea)
But you know what? The two of you 
should come see me. A little 
couples therapy. I simply have to 
see your face when she tells you 
the truth. 
BOND
Just tell me who they are Blofeld 
and then I’ll leave. I’ll leave you 
on your own.
BLOFELD
But I don’t want you to leave. 
We’re just getting reacquainted.
Bond seems to give up.
BLOFELD(CONT'D)
Alright, come. You were unusually 
patient. I need to give you 
something so you didn’t have to 
make all this way for nothing.
He motions for Bond to approach. As if no one should hear 
what he is about to say...
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME 148 148
Tanner watches Bond approach Blofeld cautiously.
TANNER
Careful Bond.BLOFELD (CONT'D)                                                     88.
89.INT. BELMARSH PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME 149 149
Bond stands directly in front of Blofeld’s cage.
BLOFELD
It was me.
BOND
You destroyed Spectre?
BLOFELD
(laughs)
No. Vesper’s grave. Madeleine 
didn’t do a thing. It was all me. I 
knew you’d come visit it. I just 
needed to wait for the bon moment. 
She lead you straight there from 
the goodness of her heart.
(beat)
And then you left her... for me.
BOND
It doesn’t matter.
BLOFELD
Oh, but it does. She still does. 
Doesn’t she?
(knowing he’s getting in 
there)
My poor little coo-coo, you were 
always so very, very sensitive.
Bond turns to the observation window.
BOND
This isn’t working.
Bond does care. Won’t show it to him.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME 150 150
Tanner leans in as if that would allow him to hear too, but 
he can’t.
TANNER
Keep going.
INT. BELMARSH PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME 151 151
Blofeld expands on his observations...                                                     89.
90.BLOFELD
All this wasted time, the life you 
could have had.
(beat)
And the reason all of this is so 
beautiful, so exquisitely 
beautiful, is that you’re coming to 
me looking for answers whereas the 
one person who knows it all is she. 
It’s Madeleine. She holds the 
secrets you need.
(beat)
All of them.
(appraising him, Bond is 
not ready to boil)
I didn’t need to kill you. I’d 
already broken you.
(just a little more)
I wanted to give you an empty 
world. Like the one you gave me
(done)
It’s enough to almost make me 
regret it... almost.
Bond fills with fury. Blofeld looks up at him smiling.
Bond leans in calmly, whispers audibly.
BOND
(just a breath)
Die.
BLOFELD
Mmmh?
Bond raises his hand around Blofeld’s neck. Throttles him.
BOND
Die... Blofeld. Die.
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 152 152
Tanner watches closely. He sees Blofeld, predominantly masked 
by Bond, start to shudder. He jumps to attention.
TANNER
Jesus! Open the door!
INT. BELMARSH PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 153 153
Bond standing over Blofeld, his hands throttling him. It’s 
intense and focused. We see the killer he is.                                                     90.
91.Bond sees himself in the reflection of the observation 
window. Suddenly stops. This is exactly what Blofeld wanted 
him to do.
Tanner appears at the window in the door.
TANNER
BOND! Bond! Open the door. Bond!
Bond releases Blofeld and steps backwards.
BLOFELD
Coo-coo!
Tanner storms into the room.
TANNER
(furious)
Who the hell do you think you are?
BOND
(dismissive)
Yes, yes,  yes. I know how to 
interrogate an asset.
TANNER
This interrogation is over.
BOND
Tanner, don’t lecture me.
TANNER
Bond, you have violated the most 
important rule in the whole bloody 
playbook.
Tanner’s face drops down to Blofeld. Bond turns now. 
TANNER(CONT'D)
Don’t move.
They see Blofeld, passed out, veins bursting in his neck, 
blisters breaking out on his face.
INT. Q’S LAB - LATER 154 154
A high-tech glider is visible in the windtunnel. 
Bond looks at his hands. Q approaches.
Q
I’m going to need those I’m afraid.                                                     91.
92.Bond supplies Bond with his thumb print for a swab. He is 
somewhere else in his mind. There’s a weight to this scene.
Q puts the swab under the microscope. 
Tanner and Moneypenny enter. Bond looks up.
TANNER
He’s dead.
Bond nods.
Q
It’s a good thing you’re not actually 
related or you’d be dead too.
Bond looks at his hands again. Nothing on them.
BOND
How do I get this off?
Q
You don’t. You can’t.
Bond looks at him, surprised.
Q(CONT'D)
(gentle attempt to lighten 
the mood)
Nanobots aren’t just for Christmas.
It doesn’t land. No-one laughs. Moneypenny gives him a look.
Q(CONT'D)
Once Heracles is in your system, it’s 
there forever.
Q and Tanner look up at the nanobots which are animating on 
the screen.
Bond turns to Moneypenny.
BOND
Did they find the car?
MONEYPENNY
We traced it but she abandoned it. 
They searched her flat. She hasn’t 
been home. Is she one of them?
BOND
I don’t know.
Just as he leaves.                                                     92.
93.MONEYPENNY
(tentative)
James, do you have any idea where 
she might have gone?
Bond gives her a look.
BOND
No. I don’t know her at all.
He walks out, tired, dejected, as if he’s given up.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 155 155
Bond driving the Vantage across the countryside. He crosses a 
bridge and turns down a track. He drives beside a fjord. He 
parks, gets out.
EXT. NORWAY - TREES - DAY 156 156
Pan over tops of trees, mirroring the very opening image.
Bond walks towards the house.
EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - DAY 157 157
Bond approaches through the woods. Gun drawn.
We see what would have been Safin’s POV of the house before 
he killed Madeleine’s mother.
INT. NORWAY SAFE HOUSE - DAY 158 158
We see Bond inside the house, gun in his hand. He checks in 
the kitchen.
MADELEINE (O.S.)
Is that for me?
Bond turns, looks up to the landing. Madeleine stares back at 
him. She is emotional, but contained. Almost unreadable.
BOND
No.
He puts the gun away.
MADELEINE
Then why did you come?                                                     93.
(MORE)                                                     94.BOND
Because you told me to.
Beat. Madeleine walks own the stairs.
MADELEINE
I didn’t think you would remember.
BOND
I remember everything.
Beat.
BOND(CONT'D)
You need to tell me who gave you 
that poison, Madeleine.
MADELEINE
Is he dead?
BOND
Yes he’s dead.
MADELEINE
Good.
BOND
He told me you didn’t betray me.
MADELEINE
I understand you’re not built to 
trust people.
BOND
Neither are you.
MADELEINE
Then we were fools for trying.
BOND
I wanted to.
Beat.
BOND(CONT'D)
I don’t know if you wanted me to 
come here, why you tried to kill 
Blofeld or who gave you the poison 
to do it or how long you have been 
working for them, but I do know 
that for what felt like five 
minutes of my life I wanted 
everything with you. And it’s not 
because I didn’t trust (you). 
(MORE)                                                     94.
BOND (CONT'D)                                                     95.It was just that feeling. I know 
I’ve come here to find out who gave 
you the poison but I’m not going to 
leave here without you knowing that 
I have loved you and I will love 
you and that I do not regret a 
single moment of my life that led 
me to you except when I put you on 
the train.
She shakes her head, she is conflicted.
MADELEINE
Do you know the worst thing about 
you?
BOND
My timing?
MADELEINE
Don’t.
BOND
My sense of humour.
MADELEINE
Don’t.
BOND
What?
MADELEINE
You look... (incredible)
Beat. They look at each other. The chemistry is palpable.
BOND
...You look incredible.
He has already reached her, taken her in his arms and kissed 
her.
Suddenly there is a noise from the top of the stairs!
They both pull apart and look up.
Sitting on the top step is a five year old girl, MATHILDE.
MADELINE
This is Mathilde.
He stares at her. She stares back. 
Blue eyes looking at blue eyes.BOND (CONT'D)                                                     95.

BOND
Hello! I’m James.
Below her a slinky continues its way down the stairs.
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE M’S OFFICE - MI6  - DAY 159 159
M sits on the sofa, looking up at a portrait of his 
predecessor. Tanner approaches holding his phone.
TANNER
Sir, we’ve located Logan Ash.
(hands the phone to M)
007 wants a word.
M takes the phone. INTERCUT WITH NOMI DRIVING in the Aston 
Martin DBS.
M
Well done 007.
NOMI
Thank you Sir. Permission for a 
capture or kill?
M
(to Tanner)
Have we cleared this with the 
Americans?
(Tanner nods)
Granted. And thank you for asking.
NOMI
By the book, Sir.
M
Your predecessor was less 
deferential.
NOMI
To be fair Sir, Commander Bond gave 
me the lead.
M
Glad to see you two are getting 
along.
NOMI
Sir.
M smiles and ends the call.                                                     96.

INT. NORWAY HOUSE - EVENING 160 160
Bond watches as Madeleine tucks Mathilde in.
MADELEINE
(in French)
If you hear anything what do you 
do?
MATHILDE
(in French)
I hide.
MADELEINE
Very good.
Madeleine kisses her.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Dis bon nuit au monsieur (say good 
night to the gentleman)
MATHILDE
Bon nuit.
Mathilde and Bond stare at each other.
BOND
Bon nuit.
Madeleine closes the blinds
MADELEINE
(to Mathilde)
Ferme les yeux (close your eyes).
Mathilde closes her eyes. Bond continues to look at her. 
Madeleine approaches.                                                     97.
98.MADELEINE(CONT'D)
She’s not yours.
BOND
Ok. But the blue eyes...
MADELEINE
She’s not yours.
BOND
Ok.
Beat.
MADELEINE
I have something to show you.
Bond looks back at Mathilde.
BOND
Another child?
He follows her down the stairs.
INT. SAFE ROOM - NORWAY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 161 161
They enter the room.
BOND
What is it with your dad and secret 
rooms? Talk to me.
MADELEINE
I wanted to bring you here 
before... (we ended) To tell you 
everything.
Bond sees the files she has opened.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Blofeld ordered my father to 
assassinate this family.
(pointing at the family 
photo)
The boy survived. His name is 
Lyutsifer Safin.
(beat)
When I was a little girl he came 
here to kill my father but found me 
and my mother instead.                                                     98.
99.MADELEINE(CONT'D)
He spared my life.
(beat)
And now he’s back.
BOND
And what does he want?
MADELEINE
Revenge?
(horrified by the thought 
of it)
Me?
The man’s obsession with her landing on both of them. He will 
never go away.
Bond sees photos of Mr White, Safin’s father and more Spectre 
agents.
BOND
Who were they?
MADELEINE
Spectre’s poisoners. My father held 
a banquet for them, used their own 
recipe in the dessert - dioxin. 
They would have suffered, horribly. 
It scarred him for life. The family 
had an island. They called it the 
Poison Garden.
BOND
So Blofeld took it from them and 
kept running it.
He takes pictures of what he needs with his phone.
BOND(CONT'D)
And now this Safin has taken it 
back.
(into his phone)
Q. Find one Lyutsifer Safin. 
Whereabouts unknown and no recent 
photographs. But I’m gonna send you 
some images of him as a boy and a 
picture of an island. So, you know, 
do your best. And I’m going to need 
a plane to get there. A big one.
(looks at Madeleine)
I’ll send you my location shortly.
Madeleine looks at him.                                                     99.
100.MADELEINE
You’re going to find him?
BOND
There are a thousand reasons why we 
need to find this man. You just 
gave me a reason to kill him.

I’m hungry.
INT. NORWAY HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER 164 164
Mathilde watches Bond prepare breakfast.
He watches her. Blue eyes looking at blue eyes.
BOND
How is it?
MATHILDE

Not bad.
Madeleine and Bond smile.
Bond’s phone rings. He picks it up. 
BOND
Excuse me.
He takes the call in another part of the room. 
INTERCUT with M, Tanner and Moneypenny in M’s office and Q in 
his lab.

Yes.
M
Bond.                                                      100.
101.BOND
You’ve found the island?
Q
Yes. It’s part of a chain in 
disputed waters between Japan and 
Russia. There’s a chemical plant 
dating back to the second world 
war.
Tanner bursts into M’s office.
Q(CONT'D)
It seems to have had quite a 
history.
TANNER
Sir, Japanese intelligence have 
reported suspicious activity on the 
island. Q, bring up the satellite 
images I just sent through. These 
were taken over the last few days. 
If that is Safin there...
M
Then Heracles is there too.
Q
Where do you need this plane Bond?
BOND
Hang on Q. Did 007 manage to locate 
Logan Ash?
MONEYPENNY
She’s closing in on him. I’ll send 
you her location.
Bond receives the text from Moneypenny.
Registers its proximity to where they are. It’s 20 miles from 
him. He looks up.
BOND
I thought she was following Logan 
Ash, not me.
TANNER
What? She IS.
MONEYPENNY
James, where are you?                                                     101.
102.He looks over at Madeleine and Mathilde.
HARD CUT TO:
EXT. HOUSE - SHORTLY AFTER 165 165
Madeleine and Bond leave the house with urgency.
Bond is carrying Mathilde. 
MADELEINE
Put her in the back.
He takes her to Madeleine’s Land Cruiser and puts her in the 
car seat directly behind the driver’s seat.
Bond and Madeleine get in the car. She looks at him in fear.
MATHILDE
(in French)
Where are we going?
MADELEINE
(in French)
We’re going on an adventure, 
darling. Hang on.
Bond starts the car. They pull away from the house.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER 166 166
They drive along a track besides a fjord.
They drive at speed. Bond is on the phone to Q.
BOND
Q, I am gonna need that plane 
quickly. At the Ørland NATO base. 
Do you think you can get it to me.
Q (O.S.)
Right. Yes, we’ll be there.
BOND
Thank you.
MATHILDE
Maman.
(in French)
A mosquito bit me.                                                     102.
103.MADELEINE
It’s okay.
MATHILDE
(in French to her toy Dou 
Dou)
Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes?
Madeleine and James look ahead of them and see something.
In the distance 2 Range Rover SVRs appear head of them. They 
approach from the other direction at high speed.
They speed past the car, back towards the house. Bond and 
Madeleine look at each other. Panic in her eyes.
Bond checks the rear view mirror. Nothing.
They keep driving. They check again. Still nothing.
Just an empty horizon behind them.
MATHILDE(CONT'D)
(in French)
Maman, do mosquitoes have friends?
MADELEINE
(in French)
I don’t know.
MATHILDE
(in French to Dou Dou)
I don’t think so.
Then... there they are. Two SVRs speeding back towards them.
Madeleine and Bond look at each other. It’s a chase.
MADELEINE
(to Mathilde)
Hang on.
The SVRs gain on them. Bond swerves right. Into an off road 
track.
I/E.  LAND CRUISER - FJORD ROAD - CONTINUOUS 167 167
The land cruiser races along a gravel road adjacent to a 
fjord.
The SVRs are gaining ground behind them.                                                     103.
104.MADELEINE
James!
Madeleine undoes her seat belt and climbs into the back seat 
to be with Mathilde. She clips herself into the middle seat 
and comforts her.
EXT. FJORD ROAD - CONTINUOUS 168 168
A wide view of the Land Cruiser and pursuing SVRs.
The SVRs reach Bond’s vehicle.
I/E.  LAND CRUISER - FJORD ROAD - CONTINUOUS 169 169
The SVRs jockey for position around Bond’s vehicle, 
attempting to stop him with aggressive manoeuvres.
One SVR slams against Bond’s left-hand side, pushing him 
towards a hill on his right.
Bond responds with a swerve that forces the SVR off the road. 
It rolls down the bank towards the water, out of commission.
The second SVR accelerates on the right-and side as Bond 
moves to his left.
Bond spots a curve of road ahead with a rocky outcropping. He 
pushes the SVR right. The SVR rides up the rock face like a 
ramp and flips into the air, sailing over the front of the 
Land Cruiser.
The immediate threat is gone. Bond veers off-road into a 
wooded area.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - RUGGED LANDSCAPE 170 170
The Land Cruiser exits the woods into an expansive landscape. 
There’s a sweeping vista of rugged hills with a river in the 
distance.
Bond hears something. Chopper blades. Can’t see where they’re 
coming from and steps on it.
On a distant hillside ahead of them several PLUMES OF DUST 
are forming. He drives down into the valley.                                                     104.
105.EXT. DAM - MOMENTS LATER 171 171
A wide view of the valley reveals the helicopter is still 
tracking the Land Cruiser. They head towards the hillside 
with the growing cloud of dust.
A treeline separates the Land Cruiser from the hillside so we 
see the source of the dust before Bond does: 3 DEFENDERS AND 
3 MOTORCYCLES barreling down the steep slope.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - DAM VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 172 172
Bond passes through the valley with the river to his left and 
a steep hill topped with trees to his right.
A sudden flurry of activity draws his attention to the 
treeline.
EXT. TREELINE - DAM VALLEY - CONTINUOUS 173 173
The 3 Defenders and 3 Motorcycles BURST through the trees at 
speed. Like charging cavalry they storm down the steep slope, 
churning up the landscape as they race towards Bond’s flank.
Bond drives with the river on his left. The vehicles fan out 
as they crest the brow of the hill above Bond.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - DAM VALLEY - CONTINUOUS 174 174
Mathilde has a direct view of the approaching onslaught 
through her window.
Bond attempts to speed ahead but can’t make it. With a sharp 
left-hand turn he diverts towards the river.
EXT. RIVER - DAM VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER 175 175
The water is only a few inches deep and no trouble for the 
Land Cruiser. Bond drives along the riverbed as the pursuing 
vehicles fall in line behind him.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - RIVER - DAM VALLEY - CONTINUOUS 176 176
Taking advantage of the new terrain Bond shifts gears and 
kicks up a huge spray with his tyres. A sheet of water 
appears behind Madeleine and Mathilde.
The Defenders and bikes have to fall back or swerve from side 
to side to maintain visibility.                                                     105.
106.The river snakes back and forth but Bond drives in a straight 
line. Madeleine and Mathilde have a hard bounce each time the 
Land Cruiser transitions between land and water.
EXT. RIVER - DAM VALLEY - CONTINUOUS 177 177
One Defender races ahead to try and cut Bond off further down 
the river.
A motorcycle chases then pulls alongside the Land Cruiser. 
Bond forces it to jump a high bank sending the rider flying.
One of the Defenders appears next to Bond and slams against 
him aggressively. The Land Cruiser is outmatched in power but 
Bond surprises the Defender with a manoeuvre that spins it 
out of control towards a steep bank. The Defender rolls 
upside down, causing an obstacle that slows down the pursuing 
vehicles.
The impassive helicopter changes tactics and soars overhead. 
It drops low over the riverbed. Ominously the helicopter 
turns to face Bond as he approaches.
Bond eyes a nearby forest which appears to hold a misty fog 
within. He re-directs the Land Cruiser and drives into the 
woods in an attempt to hide from the helicopter and remaining 
vehicles.
I/E. LAND CRUISER - FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 178 178
Bond weaves through trees, narrowly avoiding head-on 
collisions. As the fog grows thicker Bond is forced to slow.
With the reduced visibility Bond can’t tell where his 
pursuers may be. He cuts the engine and coasts the Land 
Cruiser silently through the forest.
The landscape is different here. A thriving population of 
ferns dominate the forest floor, some so tall they form a 
second canopy beneath the trees.
Bond directs the Land Cruiser into a sheltered depression and 
stops. Bond, Madeleine and Mathilde listen intently. It’s 
just the sound of their breathing and the warm engine ticking 
over. Then a barely discernible noise of a vehicle in the 
distance.                                                     106.
107.EXT. FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 179 179
Bond, Madeleine and Mathilde sit in the car. Eerie silence at 
first, and then the sound of an engine. Two. Getting louder. 
They catch a glimpse of a motorcycle strobing through the 
trees. Bond hands Madeleine his gun.
Bond carries Mathilde in his arms. Madeleine follows as they 
walk deeper into the forest where the mist thickens. Then 
Madeleine gets left behind.
Bond does his best to tread silently as he jogs with Mathilde 
clinging to his neck. He turns to Madeleine - but she’s not 
there. He spins. No sign of her.
Bond hears a rustling sound and moves to take a look. Instead 
of Madeleine he sees a motorcyclist 20 yards away looking 
straight at him. The engine bursts to life and the motorcycle 
races straight towards him. With Mathilde in his arms Bond is 
unsure how to keep her safe. As the motorcycle drives forward 
Madeleine suddenly appears from behind a tree and SHOOTS the 
driver with the gun Bond gave her, flipping him off the bike.
EXT. HUNTING HIDE - FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 180 180
Bond leads Madeleine and Mathilde to an old hunting hide, 
forming a natural hiding place.
BOND
(whispers)
Stay here. I’ll be back soon. 
Anybody comes through that door, 
you shoot them. Unless it’s me!
(to Mathilde)
You be quiet, okay. Stay really 
quiet.
Bond runs off to lure the assailants away from his family.
EXT. FERN FIELD - FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 181 181
Bond takes the dead motorcyclist’s weapons and moves through the 
forest.
Bond has found a section of the forest where the ferns are 
particularly tall and dense. 
He fires several rounds into the air and waits as the Defender 
tries to locate his position. Soon the fog near Bond is 
illuminated by a beam of headlights as the Defender appears 
through the trees.                                                      107.
108.Bond shoots directly at it with the grenade launcher. The 
vehicle flips on its side and slides forward. Bond notices a 
winch on the front, gets an idea, draws the cable around some 
nearby trees.
Bond waits for the remaining vehicles to find him. The  
motorcycle is the first to appear. Bond lures him to his  
position with gunfire. The rider is suddenly yanked from his 
vehicle when he hits the winch cable drawn between two trees. 
The remaining Defender is close behind and diverts course to 
avoid the cable. Bond runs to a new position, drawing the 
vehicle on a specific course. Ash is in the passenger seat of 
the approaching vehicle and he shoots at Bond. The driver 
doesn’t know what Bond does - the bracken near him obscures a 
massive felled tree. The Defender hits the tree at speed. Bond 
steps aside as the Defender flips end over end, crashing on its 
roof and sliding down an embankment. 
Bond walks towards the upturned vehicle. 
EXT. FERN FIELD - CONTINUOUS 182 182
Bond approaches the upturned Defender, weapon at the ready. He 
rounds it. Ash is crawling towards a tree stump, bleeding, badly 
injured. Ash sees Bond just as Bond dry fires. Nothing. Mag 
empty.
Ash smiles like a fox eating shit from a wire brush.
ASH
Nice moves Bond. 
Bond sees that the Defender is precariously balanced.
ASH(CONT'D)
You won’t be able to stop him. So 
why don’t you help me out, brother?
BOND
I had a brother. His name was Felix 
Leiter.
Bond turns and slams the Defender down, squashing Ash.
He hears gunfire in the distance and races back towards his 
family. 
EXT. HUNTING HIDE - FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
A body hits the ground. Madeleine stands over it, gun drawn. 
Mathilde hides, her hands covering her ears.                                                     108.
109.Madeleine and Mathilde hear a sound and look up to see SAFIN 
standing there, smiling.
EXT. HUNTING HIDE - FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER
Bond arrives. They’re gone. Bond hears the sound of a 
helicopter and runs towards it.
EXT. CLEARING NEAR FOGGY FOREST - MOMENTS LATER 185 185
Bond arrives in the clearing just in time to see the 
helicopter rising into the sky and fly away.
EXT. FJORD ROAD, NORWAY - LATER 186 186
Bond walks alone down the road. Nomi arrives and pulls to a 
stop by Bond.
NOMI
Need a ride?
BOND
Where have you been?
NOMI
Chasing after your lead.
Bond walks to the passenger side of her car.
INT. DBS ON THE ROAD - NORWAY - DAY 187 187
Nomi and Bond speed towards a NATO base on the coast. She can 
see he’s upset. He doesn’t speak. Tension heavy in the air.
NOMI
Ash?
BOND
Dead. 
(then)
They took Dr Swann... and her 
daughter.
Nomi looks at Bond.
NOMI
I didn’t know she had a daughter.
Nomi realises.                                                     109.
110.BOND
Did M get my plane?
NOMI
Our plane. I’m coming with you.
BOND
Thank you 007.
EXT. NATO AIRSTRIP - NORWAY - DUSK 188 188
Bond and Nomi drive onto an NATO airstrip. The car speeds 
ahead towards a waiting C-17A Globemaster.
They park.
Bond gets out and walks towards the plane.
BOND
Hello Q.
I/E. C-17A RAMP - NATO AIRSTRIP - MOMENTS LATER 189 189
Q is waiting for them, looking bleary, a pyjama shirt under 
his jacket.
Q
Bond.
NOMI
Sorry to get you out of bed.
Q follows Nomi inside the plane.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER 190 190
Bond loads a gun. 
M (O.S.)
The objectives of this mission are 
threefold.
He joins Q and Nomi at a screen.
M (CONT'D)
Confirm the presence of Heracles. 
Kill Obruchev and Safin. Get Dr 
Swann and her daughter off the 
island
(then)
And Bond?                                                     110.
111.Bond turns to the screen where M is conferencing from MI6.
M(CONT'D)
I hope they’re there.
BOND
Thank you sir.
NOMI
Sir, permission for Commander Bond 
to be re-designated as 007.
(off Bond’s look)
It’s just a number.
M
Very well. Agreed. Good luck.
The screen goes dead.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER - IN FLIGHT - CONTINUOUS 191 191
Q calls Bond over to a mobile lab set-up.
Q
Bond. Your watch.
Bond hands Q his Omega watch. Q affixes a gadget to its back. 
Hands it back.
Q(CONT'D)
It contains a limited-radius 
electromagnetic pulse. It’ll short 
any circuit on a hard wired 
network, if you get close enough.
BOND
And how strong is it?
Q
It’s fairly strong.
BOND
Fairly strong. What’s that mean?
Q
Haven’t had the time to test it 
properly. Just be careful.
Q gives Nomi a cylindrical device.
Q(CONT'D)
Right this is QDAR. It’ll map the 
space as you move through it.                                                     111.
112.Nomi taps the top of the device.
Q(CONT'D)
Don’t touch that! 
He opens a drawer, brings out an injector tracking device.
Q(CONT'D)
And smart blood will track you and 
your vitals. Bond you don’t mind a 
shot or two whilst at work. Shall 
we?
BOND
Well, I haven’t had a drink for 
three or four...
Q injects Bond with the tracking device.
BOND(CONT'D)
...Ouch! ...hours.
NOMI
Wow. Doesn’t sound like you.
Q injects Nomi with the device.
NOMI(CONT'D)
Ow!
Bond laughs. He moves towards the glider.
Q
I assume you know how the stealthy 
bird works.
BOND
No. No idea.
NOMI
Gravity.
INT. LIVING QUARTERS HALLWAY - POISON ISLAND - DAY 192 192
Safin walks Madeleine and Mathilde through a long concrete 
hallway followed by two henchmen. Primo hovers nearby.
The facility is abuzz with activity. Workers are restoring 
the building and its garden to their former glory. We see a 
pallet of shipping crates with Cyrillic lettering go by.                                                     112.
113.INT. GAMES ROOM - POISON ISLAND - DAY 193 193
A plain room, concrete walls, natural light flowing in from 
an unknown source above the ceiling.
On each wall is a window which looks out upon a garden that 
has become overgrown. Safin’s men, in hazmat suits, are 
weeding and manicuring an overgrown corner of the zen garden.
Valdo approaches.
VALDO
Welcome back Mr Safin. Welcome to 
your family.
SAFIN
How are you progressing?
VALDO
So, so good, Mr Safin. So, so good. 
SAFIN
My request.
Valdo hands Safin a small red vial.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Continue.
Valdo leaves.
MADELEINE
What is that?
SAFIN
Insurance. A simple hair falls from 
your head... And now I have your 
life in my hands
He looks at Mathilde.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
And yours!
MADELEINE
How damaged you must be to threaten 
a little girl.
SAFIN
You’re any less damaged? You love a 
killer. You bore his child despite 
his rejection, you’ve hidden and 
lied your whole life. You’ll do 
anything-                                                      113.
114.MADELEINE
To survive.
SAFIN
You understand me the same way I 
understand you.
Safin walks across the games room to a stairway opening on a 
garden.
PRIMO
(to Madeleine)
Move.
Madeleine follows with Mathilde.
EXT. ZEN GARDEN - POISON ISLAND - CONTINUOUS 194 194
Safin walks down the steps.
SAFIN
My father’s garden. It was his 
toxic treasure. Let me show her. 
Give her to me.
Madeleine is reluctant to hand Mathilde over. 
MADELEINE
No.
Primo steps forward, points his gun at Madeleine.
SAFIN
I can protect her.
MADELEINE
(to Mathilde in French)
Remember what I told you. Don’t 
touch anything. Okay?
She hands Mathilde to Safin. He walks to the garden.
SAFIN
It’s a poison garden but it’s 
perfectly safe. My father made 
this. He loved his plants so much, 
he would sing to them. I want to 
show you some of my favourites.
He speaks close to Mathilde, too close and quiet for 
Madeleine to hear. She watches like a hawk.                                                     114.
115.SAFIN(CONT'D)
Some of these plants are very 
dangerous.
(to Mathilde)
But not all of them are for hurting 
people. I have plants that can do 
all sorts of things.
He shows her one close up. Mathilde reaches out for it.
MADELEINE
Mathilde! No!
SAFIN
(points to a purple 
flower)
This one makes you do as you’re 
told, so you never misbehave and 
you’re always good. You mustn’t 
misbehave, Mathilde.
Safin looks at Madeleine. Then back to Mathilde.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
And neither must your mother. Ever.
Madeleine and Mathilde exchange a look.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
(to Mathilde)
Do you like it here?
She shakes her head.
MATHILDE
No.
SAFIN
Well you will learn to. I grew up 
here and you will too. Such a 
beautiful child. Perhaps we should 
have some tea. 
(to Primo)
Make her see the light.
Primo grabs Madeleine.
MADELEINE
No. YOU CAN’T SEPARATE US. 
MATHILDE.
MATHILDE
Maman...                                                     115.
116.MADELEINE
(in French)
Remember what I told you! I’ll come 
looking for you! Okay?
She glares at Safin, full of rage, as Primo pulls her away. 
SAFIN
(to Mathilde)
Don’t worry. You have me.
Safin walks back through the garden with Mathilde.
I/E. GLIDER - C-17A - LATE AFTERNOON 195 195
The glider is set for take-off.
Q (O.S.)
As soon as you have a line of sight 
on the island, drop altitude, stay 
below radar.
Q gives the signal for take off.
Bond and Nomi are inside, strapped in.
BOND
You ever flown one of these things 
before?
NOMI
Nope.
BANG - glider SUDDENLY drops and shoots out of the C-17A
It opens in air and beautifully soars towards the island.
Q (O.S.)
Don’t forget to release the chute 
and open the wings. Gravity isn’t 
always your friend
They’re off. Silent and focused. Soldiers.
Q (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Look for a concrete structure on 
the west side of the island. That’s 
your best bet for getting in.                                                     116.
117.EXT. SKY - NORTH JAPAN SEA - CONTINUOUS 196 196
They soar down in the glider. It lands in the ocean and 
submerges. Glides underwater toward the island.
INT. SUBMARINE PEN - MOMENTS LATER 197 197
The glider surfaces in an old Japanese submarine pen and 
docks next to a fallen gantry.
Bond climbs out. Nomi behind him.
NOMI
Coming up for air, Q.
It appears to be abandoned. There are old Soviet RIBs stacked 
between the two sub bays - but other than that no activity.
INTERCUT WITH Q IN THE C-17A GLOBEMASTER
Q
Right, good. You should be entering 
a world war two era subpen. Doesn’t 
seem to get much action but look 
out for cameras anyway. Use your 
watch Bond.
Bond uses his watch to short circuit an electronically sealed 
door.
Behind it, a wet corridor leading to a stairwell.
EXT. POISON ISLAND LOOK OUT - CONTINUOUS 198 198
The guards react as several CCTV images turn to static. A red 
light on a panel reveals a power-outage in one sector of the 
facility.
INT. SUBMARINE PEN - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER 199 199
The corridor leads to a set of very tall stairs.
Nomi activates her QDAR device, which starts to PING. They 
start ascending.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER - SAME 200 200
Q’s still on the plane. And still wobbly. Hears a ping on his 
computer and looks up.                                                     117.
118.Q
Okay. Ah, there you go.
The QDAR uses reflected sound waves to make 3-D map of the 
island’s interior. A picture is slowly rendered of the 
interior works of the island.
INT. MI6 - MORNING 201 201
M, Tanner and Moneypenny watching the same image. It can only 
map as far as the rooms they’ve entered.
Q (O.S.)
Sir? They’re in.
M
Yes, we have it.
Q (O.S.)
You should be able to see the 
chemical plant’s architecture.
MONEYPENNY
Which one’s Bond?
Q (O.S.)
He’s the erm... the Psi. The 
trident thingy.
BOND (O.S.)
Give us the layout.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER/INT. SUBMARINE PEN - STAIRWELL 202 202
Q looks at the images.
Q
Right. You’re at the edge of a 
toxic merry-go-round. The main 
activity should be towards the 
central hub which is directly above 
you.
Bond and Nomi are climbing the stairs.
INT. DEFENSIVE RING CORRIDOR -  MOMENTS LATER 203 203
Bond and Nomi move in silence through the corridor. It’s 
dark. We only see glimpses of them in the shadows.                                                     118.
119.A CAMERA shorts out. A GUARD’s face turns, hearing a noise - 
then his body gets sucked into the darkness. Nomi and Bond 
don’t make a sound as they take out their targets.
They ascend a stairway.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER - SAME TIME 204 204
Q watches the icons. Sees the signal strength plummet.
Q
Bond. Bond, there’s something... 
there’s something big up ahead. I 
can’t tell...
INT. BACTERIA FARM/C17-A GLOBEMASTER/MI6 - MOMENTS LATER 205 205
Nomi and Bond enter the large underground cavern. It’s a 
dark, swampy room with incredibly high ceilings that seems to 
be some kind of underground farm.
Nomi’s comms device squawks. She takes it out.
NOMI
These walls must be thick.
The workers stand in rows, dressed in pink hazmat suits, 
working in rhythm, stirring the water with long rods. 
Electric pod vehicles transport workers across the space. 
It’s all very strange and mysterious.
Q
Bond? Bond? 007, do you read me?
M, Tanner and Moneypenny watch the map. It ceases to render, 
like a frozen signal. Bond and Nomi’s icons not moving.
M
We’ve lost them.
Q
They’ve entered a blind spot, sir. 
I can’t work out what it is they’ve 
walked into.
M
Just get them back.
Nomi and Bond sneak around the perimeter. Reach a ladder and 
climb up to a gantry. Bond looks up and sees three large 
circular metal doors.                                                     119.
120.BOND
Well,  will you look at those 
doors.
NOMI
This was a missile silo.
BOND
Right. Let’s go.
They head for the glowing windows of a lab in the distance.
INT. OBRUCHEV’S LAB - MOMENTS LATER 206 206
Valdo’s lab: a huge cabinet of vials, monitors stream DNA 
data, refinery type systems, a bank of windows looks down at 
the bacterial acid farm below.
Bond and Nomi enter the lab with guns raised. Bond fires a 
round.
BOND
Everybody, over there. In the 
corner, now!
Valdo looks up.
VALDO
What? How?
BOND
Move! Move! On the ground.
VALDO
ALARM!
He makes a break for it. Nomi leaps onto a table and runs him 
down. Floors him with a roundhouse kick.
NOMI
Down boy.
Bond places charges throughout the lab.
VALDO
What are you doing? You cannot 
explode laboratory, please. This is 
suicide mission. Come on, you will 
never leave this island alive.
Nomi looks at the lab windows at the enormous pond outside 
after placing her last explosive.                                                     120.
121.NOMI
That was the farm.
Bond stands before several VATS brewing.
BOND
And this is the factory.
Bond gets to the cabinet now. Rows and rows of DNA vials. The 
screen displays a map with a looping animation like a 
simulation of spreading disease.
BOND(CONT'D)
They’re mass producing it. Nomi, 
come and look at this.
VALDO
You cannot stop it mister. We have 
BIG plans, you know... BIG numbers.
Nomi walks over to Bond at the screen.
NOMI
What is it?
BOND
It’s a simulation. They’re not just 
attacking individuals.
NOMI
They’re going to kill millions.
VALDO
It will not fit in a suitcase this 
time lady.
NOMI
He’s really getting on my nerves.
BOND
Well shut him up.
Nomi hits him with the butt of her gun.
Bond heads towards the windows overlooking the bacteria pond. 
Nomi joins him --
BOND(CONT'D)
We have to destroy this whole 
facility.
Then, SAFIN’S VOICE echoes around the room.                                                     121.
122.SAFIN (O.S.)
There’s no need for violence.
VALDO
(yelling)
Mr Safin! They use explosives...
Nomi silences him.
NOMI
Shut up!
SAFIN (O.S.)
Mr Bond, you have something of mine 
and I have something of yours. Why 
don’t you come up and we can talk 
about it like adults.
Out the window, Nomi and Bond see GUARDS coming down the 
gantry towards the lab. Bond points his gun at Valdo.
BOND
Safin. Where is he?
Valdo points up.
Bond hands Nomi a detonator.
BOND(CONT'D)
If I don’t come back, blow it all 
to shit.
NOMI
(quietly, aside)
We don’t have enough explosives for 
that.
BOND
(even quieter)
Yeah but they don’t know that.
Bond exits.
INT. SAFIN’S ISLAND - MADELEINE’S ROOM - SAME 207 207
A GUARD pours tea in a cup and leaves.
A dull purple flower (ATROPA BELLADONNA) slips into the tea - 
the ones from the poison garden that make you compliant.
PRIMO
He said you must drink. For your 
health.                                                     122.
123.MADELEINE
Do you trust him? He made me kill 
your last master.
(then)
Why do you think he let you join 
him?
PRIMO
I think he wants you to drink.
MADELEINE
I want him to give me my daughter 
back.
PRIMO
He said if you behave you’ll see 
her.
(then)
Drink.
MADELEINE
Do you know what this flower does?
She shows him the flower floating in the cup.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
(lying)
It makes you blind.
She looks at his one eye.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Just a drop of this in your eyes. 
And you’ll never see again.
She looks at him closer now.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
Losing one eye is a tragedy. Losing 
two...?
She looks at him. Threatening? He grabs her by her hair.
PRIMO
No games.
MADELEINE
This is not a game.
She flings the cup of tea in his face.
He turns away instinctively, falling to the floor.                                                     123.
124.She rushes him, grabs his lanyard key and rips it off. She 
uses it to open the door and rushes out, locking Primo 
inside.
INT. GAMES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 208 208
Bond enters the games room from an underground staircase. His 
rifle at the ready, sees Safin holding Mathilde. 
SAFIN
Welcome. 
Safin’s GUARD stands behind him, TWO more GUARDS have their 
weapons trained on Bond from behind the staircase.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
(refers to weapon)
On the floor.
Bond puts his rifle on the floor. As he comes up he shows his 
empty hands.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
And your sidearm. 
Bond hesitates. Safin references Mathilde --
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Careful. She’s as light as a 
feather. 
Safin tosses a cushion. It flies in the air and then explodes 
in a barrage of SILENCED GUNFIRE from the GUARD behind SAFIN.
BOND
Alright!
Mathilde covers her ears. Point taken. Bond takes out his 
sidearm and lays it on the floor.
SAFIN
Please, sit.
Bond sits opposite Safin.
BOND
(to Mathilde)
It’s going to be alright. I promise 
you it’s going to be alright.
Safin leans back. Appreciating his cards.                                                      124.
125.SAFIN
James Bond. History of violence. 
Licence to kill. Vendetta with 
Ernst Blofeld. In love with 
Madeleine Swann.    
(beat)
I could be speaking to my own 
reflection.
BOND
We’ve made slightly different 
choices. 
SAFIN
No, we’ve just developed different 
methods for the same goal. Only 
your skills die with your body, 
mine will survive long after I’m 
gone. And life is all about leaving 
something behind, isn’t it? 
He smiles at Mathilde. 
SAFIN(CONT'D)
(smiling, simple)
This doesn’t have to get ugly. You 
leave my baby alone, I’ll leave 
yours. What you think? 
Beat. 
BOND
I think you’re right. 
SAFIN
(surprised)
Thank you.
BOND
I think we are the same.  
Beat. Safin says nothing. 
BOND(CONT'D)
We both know what it feels like to 
have everything taken from us, 
before we’re even in the fight.
(beat)
It would have been nice to have a 
chance, don’t you think? We all 
should get a chance. But this thing 
that you’re building, it puts 
everyone --  the whole world on a 
battle field. Nobody gets a chance.                                                     125.
126.Beat. 
SAFIN
The thing that no one wants to 
admit is that most people want 
things to happen to them. We tell 
each other lies about the fight for 
free will and independence. But we 
don’t really want that. We want to 
be told how to live, and then die 
when we are not looking. People 
want oblivion, and a few of us are 
born to build it for them. So here 
I am: their invisible god, sneaking 
under their skin. 
BOND
You know that history isn’t kind to 
those who play God.
SAFIN
And you don’t? We both eradicate 
people to make the world a better 
place. I just want to be a 
little... tidier. Without 
collateral. I want the world to 
evolve. Yet you want it to stay the 
same. Let’s face it, I’ve made you 
redundant. 
BOND
No. Not as long as there are people 
like you in the world. And with all 
due respect to the enormity of your 
‘tidy’ achievements all you’re 
really doing is standing in a very 
long line of angry little men. 
SAFIN
I’m not angry, just passionate. 
(losing patience)
Disable your explosives, get off my 
island and you can take this 
precious little angel with you.
Pause.
BOND
And Madeleine?
SAFIN
She stays.                                                      126.
127.BOND
You know I can’t do that.  
SAFIN
That’s a shame. She really hoped 
you would. 
(then)
She knows it’s her only path to 
survival.
BOND
You have her tell me that. 
SAFIN
What mother wouldn’t sacrifice 
herself for her own child?
BOND
Is that what happened to yours?
SAFIN
My mother lay at my feet as I 
watched her die. 
Safin grips Mathilde, as if we were going to throw her like 
the cushion --
BOND
Wait, wait, wait! 
Safin hesitates --
BOND(CONT'D)
I’ll do whatever you want. 
SAFIN
Yes you will. 
Bond bows, thinking quickly --
BOND
I apologise. I’m sorry.
SAFIN
Simple choices Mr. Bond. Like do 
you want to die in front of your 
daughter...  
(beat)
Or do you want your daughter to die 
in front of you?                                                     127.
128.BOND
No, no, no. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. 
Bond bows lower. All the way down to his face. Safin is 
enjoying this. 
SAFIN
Look at your father, Mathilde. 
Safin’s hands drift off of Mathilde’s shoulders.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
This is power.
BOND
I’m sorry. Truly. Truly sorry.
Bond’s hidden PPK is out in a flash. 
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG -- First the GUARD behind 
SAFIN, then the TWO GUARDS behind him.
As they fall Bond spins his gun to Safin. But Safin’s 
disappeared through a trapdoor in the floor, and Mathilde 
with him. 
Bond runs, his gun pointed down at the place they disappeared 
just as the sliding doors close. 
Madeleine runs into the room. 
MADELEINE 
James! Where is she?
Bond still has his gun pointed at the trapdoor. He looks up. 
FUCK. 
His face says it all. 
INT. DEFENSIVE RING CORRIDOR - SAME 209 209
Safin races down a corridor, carrying Mathilde. She looks 
around for her toy.
MATHILDE
(in French)
My Dou Dou.
Mathilde bites down on Safin’s hand. Hard. 
SAFIN
Aaah!                                                     128.
129.He lets go of her and puts her down.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
If you don’t want my protection, 
then off you go.
Mathilde turns and runs down the corridor. Safin shrugs and 
continues in the opposite direction. He calls to his Guards.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Move! Our first buyers are 
arriving.
EXT. SEA 210 210
Vessels on the horizon approaching the island.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER/MI6 - SAME 211 211
Q is looking at his radar.
Q
(to MI6)
Sir, I’ve just detected some 
suspicious activity.
(looking at the C-17 spy 
cam)
Several high-speed transports are 
headed for the island. Origin 
unknown. Still no sign of 007.
M, Tanner and Moneypenny are watching the screen.
M
Come on Bond. Where the hell are 
you.
INT. BACTERIA FARM - SAME 212 212
Nomi leads Valdo away from the lab. A group of guards chase 
them down the gantry.
VALDO
This is a hopeless situation, lady. 
Please.
NOMI
Bond. Bond, the party is larger 
than the reservation.                                                     129.
130.VALDO
Please, please just let me go.
STATIC. Nomi’s surrounded. She has the detonator ready. But 
she doesn’t know if Bond is clear...
VALDO(CONT'D)
Lady, look. Just give up. I have a 
good vial for your people. Good for 
West African diaspora. It can be a 
good thing.
Nomi trades shots with the guards.
Nomi shoots a guard standing near the edge of the pool. He 
falls into the liquid and we hear his agonised screams as the 
acid dissolves his flesh.
VALDO(CONT'D)
I do not need laboratory to 
exterminate your entire race from 
the face of the earth.
NOMI
Do you know what time it is?
VALDO
What?
NOMI
Time to die.
Nomi lifts her knee and shoves Valdo off the gantry into the 
acid below. 
She trades more shots with the Guards.
INT. LIVING QUARTERS HALLWAY - SAFIN’S ISLAND - SAME 213 213
Bond and Madeleine search for Mathilde.
BOND
They dropped down to a lower level. 
There has be a stairwell down... 
They hear something and turn back.
MATHILDE
(in French)
I lost my little Dou Dou.                                                     130.
131.Mathilde is just standing there, feeling none of the fear her 
parents are. Madeleine grabs her, hugs her. Bond watches 
them.
MADELEINE
(in French)
I looked for you all over. Where 
were you?
MATHILDE
(in French)
I hid like you told me. I love you.
MADELEINE
(in French)
Me too. I love you.
BOND
We should go.
They go.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER - MOMENTS LATER 214 214
Q is still trying to reestablish contact with the island.
Q
It’s Q. Do you read me? Come in 
007. It’s Q.
He sees on the radar two fast-approaching unidentified 
objects. Suddenly the C-17 vibrates with the roar of jet 
engines as outside two MIGs buzz the C-17.
Q(CONT'D)
I think we just got buzzed.
INT. MI6 - M’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 215 215
Tanner is on the phone.
TANNER
I understand and I’m doing the best 
that I can. Just please wait.
Tanner puts down the phone.
M is stressed. He stares at the screen.
Tanner comes over.                                                     131.
132.TANNER(CONT'D)
Sir, I’ve got the Navy, the 
Japanese, the Russians all 
breathing down my neck demanding to 
know why we’ve got a C-17 circling 
a disputed island.
Beat. M shakes his head, staring at the screen, hoping for 
the little Bond dot to appear. Moneypenny looks on.
M
Don’t tell them anything just yet.
INT. DEFENSIVE RING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 216 216
Bond, Madeleine and Mathilde move down the corridor.
Suddenly Nomi appears besides them. Bond lowers his rifle.
NOMI
(to Bond)
Just in time.
BOND
Nomi... you know Madeleine, 
Mathilde. They’re my...
(whispers to himself)
Family.
Bond gets on the radio to Q. Intercut with C-17A.
BOND(CONT'D)
Q, Q are you there? 
Q
Yes Bond.
BOND
Do we have any Royal naval vessels 
in the immediate vicinity?
Q (O.S.)
Yes, why?
BOND
We’re going to need an immediate 
strike on this location. This whole 
island is a manufacturing plant for 
Heracles.
                                                      132.
133.INT. C-17A / MI6 / DEFENSIVE RING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 217 217
Q’s side. M and Tanner listening into what’s happening.
TANNER
(listening on Q’s side)
We don’t have clearance for missile 
strikes... do we?
M shakes his head.
Q
Bond, there’s something else you 
should know. Several unidentified 
ships are headed your way.
NOMI
They’re coming after Heracles. How 
far out?
Q
Twenty minutes.
M
Q. Patch me through. 007?
BOND
M?
M
Our operation is attracting a lot 
of international attention. We’re 
seeing what we can do.
EXT. SUBMARINE PEN - POISON ISLAND 218 218
Madeleine passes Mathilde to Bond already on a RIB as Nomi 
preps the motor.
Bond hands Mathilde his sweater.
BOND
It’s going to be very cold out 
there so I want you to have this to 
keep you warm.
Bond turns to Madeleine.
BOND(CONT'D)
I have to finish this. For us.
MADELEINE
I know.                                                     133.
134.He kisses her.
BOND
I’ll just be a minute.
Bond turns to Nomi.
NOMI
I’ve got them.
(throws the detonator)
This might come in handy.
BOND
Thank you.
Nomi starts the motor.
Bond watches them go.
Mathilde and Madeleine look back at Bond.
INT. DEFENSIVE RING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 219 219
Bond uses heavy fire-power to battle guards on his way back.
BOND
Q. Talk to me. 
Q (O.S.)
Our uninvited guests are fifteen 
minutes away. 
Bond takes cover as guards fire at him. Gunfire throughout 
rest of scene as he pushes forward. He takes out ONE.
M (O.S.)
Bond. M here. The situation is 
diplomatically complex. 
BOND
We don’t have a choice. Fire on my 
mark.
M (O.S.)
If we launch, the Russians, the 
Japanese and even the Americans 
will want answers. 
BOND
Well don’t give them any.                                                     134.
135.M (O.S.)
(struggles with the 
decision)
Rational minds, Bond. I’m trying to 
save this from escalating to all-
out war -
BOND
Mallory. If we don’t do this 
there’ll be nothing left to save. 
(beat)
Fire on my mark.
Bond kills TWO MORE GUARDS, relieved to hear.   
Q (O.S.)
007. There’s another problem. That 
room you were just in -
BOND
Yes, I know. I know. I’ve got to 
open the blast doors.
Q (O.S.)
Otherwise our missiles will bounce 
off it like they’ve hit a 
trampoline. 
BOND
Yes, I know. I know.
Q
Find the control room. It should be 
in a tower just above the blast 
doors. The missiles will take about 
nine minutes from launch. Do you 
think you can do it before the 
ships arrive.
BOND
Plenty of time. Plenty of time.
Bond reaches the end of the corridor. Starts up the stairs.
INT. BACTERIA FARM - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 220 220
Bond eyes the blast doors as he passes alongside the bacteria 
farm taking out guards along the way.
He sees a new wave of guards arriving near the lab. Bond 
takes out his detonator and activates the switch. The lab 
EXPLODES, forcing the guards to take cover. Bond goes through 
a door.                                                     135.
136.INT. STAIR TO CONTROL ROOM /C-17A - MOMENTS LATER 221 221
Bond makes his way up the stairs, he FIGHTS GUARDS all the 
way up, it’s a brutal slog, he gets winged, stabbed and 
knocked by grenades along the way.
Near the top of the stairs Bond is confronted by Primo, the 
last man in his way.
Bond lunges at Primo, gets his watch near Primo’s eye. Bond 
activates his EMP watch. Primo’s head EXPLODES.
Q (O.S.)
Bond. Bond! Do you read me?
BOND
Yeah... Q. I read you.
Q (O.S.)
Sounds like you’re in a rugby 
scrum.
BOND
I just showed someone your watch. 
It really blew their mind.
Q 
Right. Good
(then)
Now did you find the control room?
Bond reaches a door. It has the Russian words for ‘Control 
Room’ written on it in Cyrillic script.
BOND
Well my Russian is a little rusty 
but I think so, yeah.
Bond passes through and seals the door permanently shut. He’s 
on a landing with stairs leading down to the Zen Garden and 
stairs leading up to the control room. Bond heads up.
INT. OLD CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 222 222
Bond enters an old control room. He’s beat up. Takes a second 
to gather himself. Breathing heavily, he finds a console.
BOND
Okay Q.
Q (O.S.)
I’ve done some research...                                                     136.
137.BOND
Q, I’m gonna need some...
Q (O.S.)
Yes?
Bond starts pushing a bunch of buttons and levers.
Q (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Bond? Hello?
BOND
...Power.
INTERCUT WITH Q IN C-17A
Q
Power? Right. The infrastructure 
must go back to the 1950s so it’s 
going to be an overly complicated 
and intricate switching system. Now 
the order in which you engage it 
will need to be extremely precise.
Bond presses buttons on the console.
Q(CONT'D)
You’re looking for a control panel. 
There should be a counterweight 
clutch. Listen very carefully 007.
Bond pulls a bar. A flywheel spins. The gears come to life.
Q(CONT'D)
The first thing you need to do is 
to...
BOND
Gottit! I think.
EXT. ZEN GARDEN - CONTINUOUS 223 223
Bond’s POV: the blast doors underneath the pond in the Zen 
Garden slowly open. Water and rocks fall into the bacteria 
farm below.
When the doors open Q’s 3-D map updates to reveal the space.
INT. OLD CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 224 224
BOND
That’s it. Launch the missiles.                                                     137.
138.Q (O.S.)
Not until you’re clear.
BOND
Q. Tell M to launch the missiles 
now.
INT. C-17A GLOBEMASTER /MI6 - CONTINUOUS 225 225
Q looks at his screen.
Q
Okay. Okay. Understood. M? Bond 
says fire.
Tanner turns to M.
ADMIRAL (O.S.)
HMS Dragon here.
M
Admiral?
ADMIRAL (O.S.)
Sir.
M
M here.
ADMIRAL (O.S.)
What are my instructions?
M
You have permission to launch.
ADMIRAL (O.S.)
Roger. Launching the strike.
EXT. FRIGATE - NORTH JAPAN SEA - SAME 226 226
A massive barrage of missiles fire from the deck, bursts of 
light arcing into the sky and disappearing over the horizon.
Q (O.S.)
Missiles airborne. Nine minutes 
out.
INT. BACTERIA FARM - SAME 227 227
The blast doors are fully open. Bond’s on his way out, moving 
along the gantry, the destroyed lab behind him.                                                     138.
139.He spots Mathilde’s doll on the ground. He tucks it into his 
belt and continues towards the exit.
Suddenly there is a screeching noise and Bond looks up. The 
blast doors have started to shut again.
BOND
No... no, no, no, no, no!
EXT. ZEN GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER 228 228
Bond runs through the zen garden towards the stairway up to 
the control room. The blast doors have closed again. Water 
rushes back into the pond.
Suddenly there’s a burst of gunfire. Bond takes multiple 
hits. He tumbles into the pond. Safin appears.
Safin wades into the pond with his gun raised, getting as 
close as he can for the kill shot.
SAFIN
Quite a mess you’ve made. Like an 
animal.
Bond grabs his arm. Twists it. As they struggle Safin strikes 
something against Bond’s cheek but he hardly notices. We hear 
a crack as Bond breaks Safin’s arm and his gun falls into the 
water.
Bond lies exhausted in the water, Safin opposite. Both soaked 
with each other’s blood.
On Bond’s cheek are small strange scratches oozing blood. 
Bond stares at the water in a daze like a wounded bull. We 
see their blood swirling in the water, mixing.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
Now we’re both poisoned with 
heartbreak.
(smiles)
Two heroes in a tragedy of our own 
making.
(Bond starting to put it 
together)
Anyone we touch... we are their 
curse... a stroke to their cheek, a 
kiss would kill them instantly.
(off Bond’s reaction)
Yes. Madeleine.
(then)
Yes. Mathilde.                                                     139.
140.Safin opens his bleeding palm. There are shards of broken 
glass in his skin. Pieces from the RED VIAL.
SAFIN(CONT'D)
You made me do this. This was your 
choice.
Bond gets up. He retrieves Safin’s gun from the water and 
shoots Safin. KILLS HIM.
Bond stands. Turns away from Safin’s body. He is emotional. 
We hold on him. The emotions boiling.
INT. STAIRWAY TO CONTROL ROOM 229 229
Bond makes his way up the stairs. There’s no one left to 
fight. He’s alone.
BOND
Q? Q, are you there?
Q (O.S.)
Bond, there you are.
BOND
Are they safe Q?
Q (O.S.)
Yes they’re safe. Bond, have you 
left the island?
BOND
There’s a slight problem with the 
blast doors. Won’t take a second.
INTERCUT WITH Q IN C-17A
Q (O.S.)
No Bond, the missiles have already 
launched. Just get out of there.
Bond gets to the top of the stairs.
INT. OLD CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 230 230
Bond pulls the lever, reopening the blast doors, and staggers 
back from the control panel.
BOND
Q, how do I destroy this thing?                                                     140.
141.Q (O.S.)
If the silo doors are open the 
missiles will deal with it.
BOND
No, no. If you get it on you how do 
you get it off?
Q (O.S.)
You know as well as I do that you 
can’t. It’s permanent. It’s eternal 
which is why we have to destroy it. 
For Christ’s sake James just get 
off the island. It’s harmless 
unless you’re near to the target.
BOND
Well, that’s not gonna work.
INTERCUT WITH Q IN C-17A
Q
(realising)
Oh God. Oh God. It’s for Madeleine.
BOND
It’s alright Q. It’s alright. Would 
you put Madeleine on, please?
Q (O.S.)
Yes, of course. How stupid of me.
Bond releases a ladder and starts climbing up to the roof.
EXT. NEARBY ISLAND - CONTINUOUS 231 231
Madeleine and Mathilde are with Nomi. 
Q (O.S.)
Nomi, come in.
Nomi tunes into her comms.
Q (O.S.)(CONT'D)
Put Madeleine on.
NOMI
(calls out)
Madeleine.
Nomi passes the radio to Madeleine. INTERCUT with Bond 
climbing the ladder.                                                     141.
142.MADELEINE
James?
BOND
Madeleine.
MADELEINE
I’m here. Where are you? Is it 
done? James?
BOND
Yes, yes. He’s dead. Are you both 
there?
MADELEINE
Yes.
BOND
Good. You’re safe. That’s good.
MADELEINE
Have you left?
BOND
No.
(pause)
I’m not gonna make it.
MADELEINE
What?
BOND
No.
MADELEINE
But you promised.
BOND
Madeleine.
MADELEINE
Just get off that island. I know 
you can do this. Everything  is 
good now. There’s no one left to 
hurt us.
EXT. ROOF OF OLD CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 232 232
Bond arrives at the roof. He has a view to the water and 
Madeleine’s island in the distance. INTERCUT with Madeleine.                                                     142.
143.BOND
Madeleine. You have made the most 
beautiful thing I have ever seen.  
She’s perfect because she came from 
you.
MADELEINE
Oh God! The vial. You’ve been 
poisoned?
BOND
Yes.
MADELEINE
(she knows it’s hopeless)
There must be a way. We just need 
more time. If we only had more 
time.
BOND
You have all the time in the world.
MADELEINE
I love you.
BOND
I love you too.
We see the missiles fly through the air.
Madeleine, Mathilde and Nomi watch them. They are strangely 
beautiful.
MADELEINE
She does have your eyes.
BOND
I know.
Bond looks up and sees the missiles headed straight for him.
BOND(CONT'D)
I know.
Long contrails of smoke streak from the distance to dozens of 
white points of light, moving faster and faster towards him.
The missiles break into clusters as they spread for maximum 
effect. Bond knows he only has milliseconds. He seems to find 
peace. Breathes in deeply, finding some quiet before --
A massive wave of explosions ripple towards Bond in a 
strobing and flashing cloud of light.                                                     143.

A few days later. Establisher of the MI6 building against the 
London skyline.
M (O.S.)
It’s very hard to know what to say 
but I thought we should gather --
INT. MI6 - M’S OFFICE - DAY 237 237
A lone glass of whiskey is placed on the table.
M (O.S.)
-- And remember
M, Moneypenny, Tanner, Nomi, Q are all gathered in M’s 
office. They each hold a glass of whiskey.
M(CONT'D)
And I thought this was appropriate.
M reads from a book of poetry.
M(CONT'D)
The function of man is to live, not 
to exist. I shall not waste my days 
trying to prolong them. I shall use 
my time.
The each take their glass. Solemn. Raise them.                                                     144.
145.ALL
[To] James.
They drink. Put their glasses down. Hiding their emotion.
M
Right. Back to work.
Tanner clinks his glass against the lone glass on the table.
EXT. MATERA - ONE MONTH LATER 238 238
It’s summertime. Madeleine drives the V8 Vantage down a 
winding Italian road. Mathilde is sitting next to her.
MADELEINE
Mathilde, I need to tell you a 
story.
MATHILDE
Quoi? (What?)
MADELEINE
I’m going to tell you a story.
Mathilde looks at her.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
About a man. 
Madeleine drives. Thinking. She smiles.
MADELEINE(CONT'D)
His name was Bond. James Bond.
Mathilde smiles.
We follow the Vantage from above as it winds up into the 
mountains. The noise of the world fades away.
Louis Armstrong’s “We have All The Time in the World” starts 
to play. Credits roll over the driving car.
The car enters a tunnel. The camera leads.
The tunnel forms an iris of darkness that slowly closes in, 
bringing us into black.
END.                                                     145.
