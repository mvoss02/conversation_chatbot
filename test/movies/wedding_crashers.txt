FADE IN:
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - DAY 1 1
A small Boston law firm. A few lawyers and clients mill 
about. We zero in on one door with a plaque that reads "John 
Beckwith." JOHN BECKWITH, an attorney, early thirties, is 
sitting at his desk in a well appointed office talking on the 
phone angrily.
JOHN
Oh bullshit! You saw the 
surveillance videotape. Your 
client’s slip and fall was the 
biggest acting job since I took the 
stage in eighth grade as Othello. 
And I blew!
(beat)
Never gonna happen. Maybe a quarter 
of that. Maybe. I'll talk to the 
insurer.
John's attention is captured by a hot secretary walking by.
JOHN
(continuing)
Great. Talk to your client.
(beat)
Yeah, next Friday. I got good 
seats. Bring that girl, your friend 
-- with the hair? Yeah. Okay.
John hangs up the phone and puts his feet up on the desk.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - CONTINUOUS 2 2
JEREMY KLEIN, a Divorce lawyer, early 30's, sits at a desk 
with a WOMAN, also in her thirties. His eyes wander to the 
same hot secretary now walking by his office.
WOMAN
Eight years of marriage all shot to 
hell.
JEREMY
(eyes following the 
secretary's ass)
Had I known you eight years ago I 
would have advised you to avoid the 
wedding.
WOMAN
2.
But I do believe in the institution 
of marriage.
Jeremy's attention is jolted back to the woman.
JEREMY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you say the 
"institution?" No, no. The Boston 
Red Sox are an institution. 
Pastrami on rye is an institution. 
Mr. Rogers is an institution -- 
Marriage is a curse. Our punishment 
for original sin.
The woman is taken aback.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Do you understand the ugliness I 
see here every day? The sheer 
torment? The absolute hell? Just 
because people like you -- and God 
bless your innocent heart, really 
believe in the "institution" of 
marriage!
WOMAN
My parents were happily married.
JEREMY
No. They really weren’t. You think 
they were. But they really weren’t.
WOMAN
They weren't?
Jeremy shakes his head.
WOMAN
(continuing; beat)
Mom did drink -- quite a lot.
JEREMY
Of course she did. They all do.
(ushering the woman out)
Don't worry, we'll go for the 
jugular.
He shakes her hand and the woman exits. He sees John down the 
hall and motions for him to come by. John enters and plops 
down on the couch.
JOHN
So what's up?
3.
Jeremy reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of 
single malt scotch with a ribbon around it and hands it to 
John.
JEREMY
Happy Anniversary.
JOHN
Huh?
JEREMY
Fifteen years, my friend!
John looks perplexed.
JEREMY
(continuing)
June 11, 1988? Paul Revere High? 
Junior Prom night?
JOHN
Ohhhh. Right. Yeah. The night we 
met.
JEREMY
Could you sound more underwhelmed?
JOHN
I’m not underwhelmed.
JEREMY
You took Barbara Rothstein to the 
prom and wound up in the men's room 
making out with another girl.
JOHN
And you were in the stall next to 
me making, out with some chick who 
was not your date. Who was your 
date?
JEREMY
Mary Theresa Spinolli. Don't you 
remember? Turned out she was 
cheating on me!
JOHN
Ohhh. That's right.
JEREMY
I knew that night that you and I 
were cut from the same cloth. Best 
friends forever.
(heat)
4.
I can't believe you forgot.
JOHN
A lot on my mind.
JEREMY
You think it's gay, don't you? The 
anniversary thing --
JOHN
I don't think it's gay.
JEREMY
Because you forgot on our tenth, 
too. Remember I got you that beer-
of-the-month ciub thing?
JOHN
Yeah, that was great. The beer.
JEREMY
You thought it was gay.
JOHN
I didn't think it was gay, for 
Christ's sake! It was beer!
JEREMY
Then how come you never get me 
anything for our anniversary?
JOHN
Okay -- what you said right there? 
That was a little gay.
JEREMY
Oh, fuck you. Anyway, we’ve got a 
big three weeks ahead of us.
JOHN
Yeah. End of the wedding season. 
How many weddings are we gonna 
crash?
Jeremy looks at his daytimer.
JEREMY
I've got us down for eight.
JOHN
Any of them cash bars?
JEREMY
Two. But I got it covered,
5.
(pulling out two medals)
Purple hearts. We won’t have buy a 
drink all night.
JOHN
Perfect.
JEREMY
Eight opportunities to get laid, my 
friend. Eight opportunities to 
score with women so aroused by the 
thought of marriage they mistakenly 
hook on to us as the men of their 
dreams.
JOHN
Bingo. I'll get my tux.
Jeremy walks to his door and grabs a clothing bag. They exit.
EXT. TEMPLE BETH SHALOM - VESTIBULE - LATER 3 3
John and Jeremy, in tuxedos, enter the Synagogue and 
introduce themselves to the ushers.
JOHN
Hi, Lou Epstein.
JEREMY
Chuck Schwartz.
They both put on their yarmulkes.
INT. SYNAGOGUE - A LITTLE LATER 4 4
The service is in full swing. The Rabbi is chanting. John 
glances at a pretty young woman sitting down the aisle from 
him. She's choked up. She looks at John and smiles. John 
takes out a handkerchief and dabs a fake tear from his eye. 
The woman takes a breath, she’s smitten. It takes a real man 
to cry at a wedding. CLOSE ON: John's hand. He's concealing a 
small tube of "Bausch and Laumb Hypo Tears."
Jeremy makes eye contact with another woman. She returns the 
eye contact. Jeremy smiles and turns away. She's not the one. 
He looks to his left and catches the gaze of a young blonde 
woman. She briefly returns his glance and half-smiles. Jeremy 
smiles. She’s the one.
INT. SYNAGOGUE - A LITTLE LATER 5 5
6.
The Rabbi concludes, the Groom steps on the glass, the crowd 
including our guys shout, "Mazel Tov!"
INT. BALLROOM - LATER 6 6
The reception is in full swing. As a sort of hip Klezmer band 
plays, we see John and Jeremy practicing the fine art of 
wedding crashing:
John does a-magic trick for some kids,
Jeremy dances with the bride’s mother. She's blushing.
John slaps some old guy on the back as John shares with him a 
disingenuous laugh.
Jeremy raises his glass to toast the happy couple.
John raises his glass to toast the happy couple.
Jeremy does magic tricks for the kids.
John dances with the bride’s mother.
Jeremy dances with the second woman he made eye contact with.
John dances slowly with the woman who saw him cry.
Jeremy, in a secluded alcove, is about to kiss the woman he 
was dancing with.

dancing with.

Huh?
JOHN
(recovering)
What? Oh! The fans got unruly -- 
and there were trades -- it was 
ugly.

An OLD COUPLE look toward John who's at full-throttle,

John and Jeremy are just beginning to dance to the perennial

"It makes you want to shout! Put 
your hands up and shout!"

John and one of the women we’ve seen from a wedding jump into 
bed as "Shout" continues to play.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 23 23
Jeremy and one of the women we’ve seen from a wedding also 
jump into bed as "Shout" keeps playing.
INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS 24 24
We intercut between DIFFERENT WOMEN with John and Jeremy 
jumping into bed. "Shout" still plays.
INT. VARIOUS DANCE FLOORS - RECEPTIONS AND BEDROOMS 25 25
The music gets louder and louder. A rapid sequence of dance 
floors, receptions, winks, nods, kisses, toasts as the music 
crescendos. When we hear the final "shout," the music stops 
and we cut to John and Jeremy each rolling off of their 
respective women. Jeremy sighs contentedly. John stares off 
pensively: something's missing.
INT. JOHN’S OFFICE - DAY 26 26
John is at his desk, working. Jeremy walks right in and sits 
down, holding a newspaper.
JEREMY
John, I am holding the Kentucky 
Derby of wedding announcements!
JOHN
I thought we were done for a while?
JEREMY
This is different. This is the 
Secretary of the fucking Treasury!!
JOHN
Cleary?
JEREMY
Yes, Cleary's daughter! Out on the 
Cape!
JOHN
(unenthusiastic)
Mm hmm.
JEREMY
11.
What's wrong with you? This is the 
Clearys!! They're an institution! 
We've never crashed anything like 
this! Five hundred single women. 
Three live bands! Oysters!
JOHN
Okay --
Jeremy stares at him.
JEREMY
"Okay?!" See? This is what I'm 
talking about!
JOHN
I'm tired, all right?! My feet 
hurt. My voice is hoarse.
JEREMY
You don't care about this anymore!
JOHN
What are you talking about? Of 
course I care!
JEREMY
At the Buckner nuptials, you were 
in the corner, sulking!
JOHN
I wasn’t sulking! I twisted my 
ankle.
JEREMY
Rule six: Don't sit in the corner 
and. sulk. It draws attention in a 
negative way. Draw attention to 
yourself oil your own terms!
JOHN
I know the rules, Jeremy!
JEREMY
When Chazz Reinghold gave us those 
sacred rules of wedding crashing 
twelve years ago, he passed on a 
legacy. We have a responsibility 
here.
JOHN
You know, you make it sound like a 
cult. Chazz Reinghold was a kook!
12.
JEREMY
Bite your tongue! He was not kook! 
He was, a brave and decent man!
JOHN
He lived with his mother until he 
was forty! She tried to poison his 
oatmeal! Even she couldn’t take it!
JEREMY
That was never proven! And anyway, 
what about Rule Three?! Rule Three 
for Chrissakes, John!
JOHN
Oh not that again --
JEREMY
Rule Three: Toast in the native 
language if you know the native 
language and have practiced the 
toast. Do not wing it! Last week 
you when you toasted the groom in 
Hindi --
JOHN
Ok! I got a couple of words mixed 
up. Big deal!
JEREMY
A couple of words mixed up?! You 
told the entire wedding party that 
the bride was very lucky because 
her new husband smelled like the 
anus of the cobra!
JOHN
I meant, he had the power -- of the 
-- cobra! Okay?! -- anyway I 
managed to turn that into a 
compliment, did I not?!
JEREMY
Oh please -- So do you want to do 
this or not?
JOHN
Give me the paper.
John grabs the paper from Jeremy and reads the announcement.
JOHN
(continuing; beat)
13.
All right, well first of all, I’m 
not saying it's impossible, but it 
is going to require some planning.
JEREMY
There's my man. He's back. My man 
is back!
EXT. CHURCH YARD - MORNING - A WEEK LATER 27 27
John and Jeremy are standing outside John's car in front of a 
very nice old Catholic church on the Cape. They're in their 
tuxes, both putting on their cufflinks, combing their hair, 
etc. We see guests milling about in front of the church.
JOHN
Okay, let's do our pre-game.
JEREMY
What's to know? Big Catholic 
wedding. Lots of rich fuckers. Hot 
chicks. We can do this in our 
sleep.
JOHN
Rule one: Always prepare.
JEREMY
Fine. What do you have?
John reaches in the car and hands him a folder.
JOHN
A few articles on Secretary 
Cleary's economic policy. Skim them 
quickly. Also a roster of the key 
family members. A glossary of 
sailing terms. Sailing's like sex 
to these people.
Jeremy looks over the folder.
JEREMY
(reading to himself)
Okay -- Harvard -- Kennedy School 
of Government -- Mom's big with the 
charities blah blah blah. Three 
daughters, one son, a million 
foundations. Barf. Puke. Gag. Okay. 
Got it. What's our back story?
JOHN
14.
We're brothers from New Hampshire. 
We're venture capitalists.
JEREMY
I'm sick of that one. Why don't we 
be from -- Vermont and -- and have, 
say, an emerging maple syrup 
conglomerate.
JOHN
Because we don't know anything 
about maple syrup.
JEREMY
I know everything about maple 
syrup. I love maple syrup.
JOHN
I love red vines. Doesn't mean we 
should be the red vine barons, 
right?
JEREMY
Good point.
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER 28 28
John and Jeremy walk toward the church confidently. They see 
two men checking names as the guests enter the church. John 
and Jeremy stop about twenty feet from the church. They see 
men in suits with earpieces.
JOHN
I knew it! Secret Service.
JEREMY
Yeah. So?
JOHN
So they don't mess around. They're 
trained to take bullets.
JEREMY
Big deal. I could take bullets.
JOHN
Oh, please. You-won't even get a 
flu shot. Maybe we should catch 
that Portuguese wedding down in New 
Bedford. They'll have, those 
sausages you like.
JEREMY
15.
Fuck the sausages. We're hitting 
this one. Everything we've done for 
the last twelve years, all that 
hard work, has lead us to this 
moment.
JOHN
Fine. How do you want to get in?
JEREMY
Okay. Let me think.
(beat)
We'll do an end run!
JOHN
Guarded.
JEREMY
Shit!
(BEAT)
Hey! We'll create a disturbance!
JOHN
Not with these guys. Disturbances 
just hype their radar.
JEREMY
Okay, then what do you got?
John looks to the parking lot behind Jeremy and sees a large 
mini-van pull up. A BIG GRODP of people get out of the mini  
van. Probably some sort of extended family.
JOHN
Let's just rush in with this big 
group.
JEREMY
A rush?! You want to do a rush?
JOHN
Yeah, what's wrong with a rush?
JEREMY
It's amateur hour, buddy. It's bush 
league. We' re better than a rush.
The big group walks toward the church.
JOHN
It'll work.
JEREMY
16.
No. A rush is how you crash the 
Journey concert when you're 
thirteen. We're not gonna do a 
rush. It's beneath us. We’re 
craftsmen.
A member of the big group points to a name on the list and 
the big group starts to file into the church.
JOHN
Go!
John pushes Jeremy into the big group and they successfully 
enter the church under their cover.
INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS 29 29
John and Jeremy enter to find a beautiful old church. John 
notices an attractive WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS talking to a 
friend. They're pointing to various seats trying to make a 
decision.
JOHN
(to the woman in the blue 
dress)
Five rows back. Close enough to the 
altar but far enough back to see 
the bride's entrance.
The woman in the blue dress smiles at him.
JOHN
(continuing)
Now, a lot of people go for the 
aisle. That's a mistake. You have 
that whole "should I make eye 
contact with the bride" business.
JOHN
You don’t want that. It's awkward. 
Fifth row back, second seat in. 
Trust me.
WOMAN IN THE BLUE DRESS
That's great. Thank you so much.
She smiles at John and walks to the seat he recommended.
JOHN
I have to hit the head.
JEREMY
17.
Okay. I'll get us some seats on the 
groom’s side.
Jeremy finds seats as John heads tc the bathroom.
EXT. CHURCH BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 30 30
The GROOM is leaning against a urinal, hyper-ventilating and 
dry-heaving before the service as John enters. John has seen 
this many times before. He stands at the next urinal.
JOHN
Yeah, I know what you’re thinking.
The groom startled, turns around.
JOHN
(continuing)
You're thinking, "What have I done? 
I’m over. I’m finished. Now it 
ends." And at what? Twenty-six?
The groom nods.
JOHN
(continuing)
Twenty-six years of pure uncut 
premium Grade- А  sexual freedom. 
Yeah, it’s a drug. A drug that 
makes morphine look like skittles, 
and it's going right down the 
toilet as you descend into the 
abyss of country kitchens, dirty 
diapers, mind-numbing conversation 
about her "needs" and worse, the 
same sex with the same person, day 
after day, night after night, year 
in, year out.
The groom starts retching again.
JOHN
(continuing)
Well, you’re wrong. It's-not like 
that. You see it as the beginning 
of the end. No, my friend! It's the 
end of the beginning --
The groom looks up, encouraged.
JOHN
(continuing)
18.
You're about to enter a world so 
complex and fulfilling, it makes 
your old life of endless boozing, 
late nights, and meaningless pieces 
of ass seem like the shallow 
depressing graveyard that it really 
is.
The groom nods,
JOHN
(continuing)
A world rich with deep love, 
adoration and appreciation from a 
life partner -- well this kind of 
happiness you never dreamed 
possible. It's a mystery, a gift 
that God gave us. And when the kids 
come? They call you Daddy -- and 
you're their hero. And you end up 
growing old with someone whose love 
for you is timeless, endless. 
Someone who knows what you're 
thinking before you say it. Who'll 
take care of you when you're sick, 
comfort you when you're sad, laugh 
with you, cry with you.
The groom takes a deep breath.
JOHN
(continuing)
Someone you never have to impress, 
but always want to. Most men would 
give up their left arm to be in 
your shoes.
GROOM
(beat, he’s better)
Thank you --
JOHN
No problem.
(pointing to the door)
Now, go get ’em.
John watches the groom start to exit. But before re-entering 
the church, the groom stops and turns around.
GROOM
Hey, how long have you been 
married?
JOHN
19.
Oh -- I'm not. married.
(beat)
I might try to nail that chick in 
blue dress, though. Shd seems nice.
The groom looks perplexed as John exits.
INT. CHURCH - A MINUTE LATER 31 31
John kneels down next to Jeremy in the pew, who's pretending 
to be in prayer. They both pretend to be in prayer as they 
start scoping potential women. They sit back down.
JEREMY
(sotto)
Third row. Straw hat.
JOHN
(sotto)
You know that women who wear hats 
never give it up. C'mon!
JEREMY
(a little too loud)
What? That’s not true! I bagged 
that hat chick at the Martingano 
wedding!
People turn around. John smiles apologetically.
JOHN
A little louder. I don't think the 
Priest heard you.
A COUPLE in their fifties sit down next to John. The man 
reaches out his hand to John.
MAN
Frank Myers.
JOHN
(shaking his hand)
John Ryan. This is my brother 
Jeremy.
Jeremy nods.
FRANK
So, how do you know the groom?
JOHN
Oh, we’re --
(quick beat of thinking)
20.
Uncle Ned's kids.
FRANK
Uncle Ned? Is he Liz's brother?
JOHN
Yeah -- Liz's brother.
FRANK
Great. How is everybody?
JOHN
Oh really. Dad's fine. Aunt Liz 
sends her best. She couldn't make 
it.
FRANK
Uh -- I know. She's dead.
Jeremy leans over. He's had to do this before.
JEREMY
She sends her best from the grave. 
We've become very spiritual.
FRANK
I see --
Franks smiles and turns away.
JEREMY
(sotto to John)
How many times are you gonna do 
this? If you're going to commit to 
a relative, be sure make you know 
whether they have a pulse.
The groom comes out unto the altar. The guests turn toward 
the back of the church. John and Jeremy turn to see a 
groomsmen escort a very old lady to her seat.
This is MARY CLEARY, the grandmother of the bride and the 
matriarch of the Cleary family. Next, two groomsmen walk the 
mother of the bride, KATHLEEN CLEARY to her seat. She has the 
glow of someone who has been drinking every day for the last 
twenty-five years.
A cute FLOWER GIRL, about seven, walks lip the aisle, 
concentrating hard on what she’s supposed to be doing. She 
takes two deliberate steps and them tosses some flower 
petals.
FLOWER GIRL
21.
Step. Step. Throw. Step. Step. 
Throw.
She continues to do this until she gets near the altar. 
Noticing that she still has a lot of petals left, she empties 
the rest of the flowers unto the floor and sits down in the 
first aisle.
Next, groomsmen and bridesmaids start to walk down the aisle. 
One of the bridesmaids is GLORIA CLEARY, the bride's youngest 
sister. She's attractive in a sweet and wholesome sort of way 
and Jeremy elbows John.
JEREMY
(sotto)
Hello.
(then to John)
Dibs.
JOHN
All yours, my friend.
A groomsman, SACK LODGE, walks the maid of honor, CLAIRE 
CLEARY, the bride’s sister, down the aisle. She's very 
attractive and John takes notice. When she gets to the altar, 
a String Quartet plays "Here Comes the Bride." The guests 
stand as the BRIDE is walked down the aisle by her father, 
TREASURY SECRETARY WILLIAM CLEARY.
John takes a look at the bride and turns to Jeremy.
JOHN
(continuing)
I think we've got a crier.
JEREMY
Nah --
JOHN
Twenty bucks?
JEREMY
You’re on.
The Secretary walks the bride to the altar and after giving 
her a kiss on the cheek, sits down next to his wife. The 
bride immediately starts bawling.
JEREMY
Jesus --
Jeremy reaches into his wallet and hands John a twenty.
22.
INT. CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER 32 32
John and Jeremy are bored Like crazy. The Priest, FATHER 
O'NEIL, a grandfatherly sort, continues the service.
FATHER O’NEIL
Now, for our next reading, I’d like 
to invite the bride’s sister, 
Gloria, up to the lectern.
JOHN
(sotto to Jeremy)
Twenty bucks says it's First 
Corinthians.
JEREMY
No way. Colossians. 3:12.
Gloria walks up to the lectern, opens the bible and starts 
reading.
GLORIA
A reading from Paul’s first letter 
to the Corinthians.
Jeremy rolls his eyes. He reaches into his pocket and pulls 
out another, twenty and hands it to John.
GLORIA
(continuing; reading)
"Love is patient. Love is kind--”
JEREMY
(sotto, mimicking)
Love is bullshit. Love' sucks dick.
INT. CHURCH - FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER 33 33
Jeremy is dozing off in the pew. John elbows him. Jeremy 
jolts awake and dabs some fake tears under his eyes.
JEREMY
(by rote)
I just love to see young people 
happy.
FATHER O’NEIL
Craig and Christina are both quite 
the sailing, enthusiasts . So it 
came as no surprise to any of us 
when Craig proposed to Christina 
while sailing the Caribbean.
23.
John and Jeremy look at each other and feign a dry-heave.
FATHER O'NEIL
(continuing)
Speaking on behalf of all of us, I 
think I can say confidently that 
this marriage will be
(thinks this is clever)
smooth sailing all the way. Now, 
the bride and the groom have 
elected to say vows that they 
themselves have written.
The RING BEARER hands the Priest the pillow that carries the 
rings. The Priest hands a ring to the groom who places it on 
the bride's finger.
GROOM
I Craig, take you Catherine to be 
my wife, my best friend, and my 
first mate.
Claire, the maid of honor, makes a face that says "Oh, 
please." John notices this and smiles.
GROOM
(continuing)
To captain our ship of love and to 
stay with that ship no matter how 
rough the seas.
Claire has to stifle laughter.
GROOM
(continuing)
Through health and sickness, clear 
skies and squalls.
Claire lets out a little laugh. John can't take his eyes off 
of her. In ten years of wedding crashing, he has never seen 
anyone in the bridal party laugh during the vows.
GROOM
(continuing)
You are the star I set my course 
to. You are my magnetic north. My 
sextant always point to you.
Claire can't fight it, she laughs. She coughs to cover her 
laugh. The Bride looks crossly at her.
CLAIRE
Sorry. Tickle in my throat. Please 
continue.
24.
JEREMY
(to John)
Well, this is a first.
JOHN
(enamoured)
She 1s amazing --
The bride places a ring on the groom's finger.
BRIDE
I Christina take you, Craig, to be 
my husband, my best friend, and my 
Captain.
Claire's in agony, pinching herself to keep from losing it.
BRIDE
(continuing)
To be your anchor and your sail, 
your starboard.and your port, your 
bow and your stern.
Claire has to turn around. Her shoulders are heaving.
BRIDE
(continuing)
Your life, your love, your lady, 
and the sea.
Still turned around, Claire snort, laughs.
FATHER O’NEIL
By the power vested in me the Roman 
Catholic Church and by the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I 
now pronounce you Husband and Wife.
(to the Groom)
You may now --
(a little reluctantly)
-- kiss the first mate.
Claire explodes in laughter which is drowned out by the 
guests' applause as the Bride and Groom walk down the aisle. 
The groomsmen and bridesmaids file out after them. John 
studies Claire the whole way down the aisle. He's enthralled. 
Jeremy winks at Gloria who blushes.

John and Jeremy walk through an entrance area and into a 
large banquet room. John's holding a gift. Off to the side is 
a bar area and off to the.other side is a deck with an ocean 
view. Everything is decorated beautifully. There are opulent 
platters of food. A SWING BAND is playing. It's like 
something from Gatsby. A waiter comes by with a tray of 
lobster canapes. They each take one. Then Jeremy takes 
another. The waiter walks off. Jeremy looks around. He's in 
heaven. Women and food.
JEREMY
Sweet, huh? What did I tell you?
JOHN
You said it would be sweet.
John sees Claire, the Maid of Honor arrive. He smiles.
JOHN
(continuing)
Get us seats near -- but not too 
near -- the bridal party. I'll drop 
the fake present.
JEREMY
Excellent. And if you see any crab 
cakes, grab me sortie. Got to have 
some crab cakes.
John walks off to find the gift table. Jeremy surveys the 
room. He looks at the name cards on the plates and pulls out 
several name cards from his coat pocket. He shuffles through 
the cards and finds a style match. He takes' two other cards 
from the table.
JEREMY
(continuing; to himself)
Sorry Mr, and Mrs. Burgess. I'm 
sure we’ll find you another lovely 
table.
Jeremy places his fake cards down on the table. CLOSE ON; The 
new NAME CARDS read "John Ryan" and "Jeremy Ryan."
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A MINUTE LATER 35 35
John approaches the wedding present table and places the fake 
gift down. CLAIRE walks up' and starts checking out the 
gifts. She picks up a medium size box and gives it a little 
shake.
JOHN
Fondue set.
26.
Claire’s not sure what he's talking about.
CLAIRE
Excuse me?
JOHN
The present you’re holding. It's a 
sterling silver fondue set.
He holds out his hand.
JOHN
(continuing)
John Ryan.
CLAIRE
Claire Cleary.
(re. present)
How do you know?
JOHN
Sort of a psychic.
CLAIRE
Really?
(picks up another one)
What’s this one, then?
JOHN
Knife set. Very nice. German.
Claire picks up another.
JOHN
(continuing)
Cotton linens, Egyptian.
John quickly picks up a series of presents names all of them.
JOHN
(continuing)
Place setting. Candlesticks. 
Crystal Stemware -- which they’ll 
never use by the way and, I have to 
say, is bad karma.
She holds up a small box.
JOHN
(continuing)
Massage oils and a book on Tantra. 
Probably from the wackv Aunt.
CLAIRE
27.
(looking at gift card)
Aunt Millie. Wow. You definitely 
have a gift.
JOHN
Yes. Unfortunately, my powers only 
apply to useless consumer products.
CLAIRE
Well, look, if one day, the police 
need someone to find a missing 
Belgian waffle maker, you’re there.
John laughs. Claire’s mom Kathleen approaches.
KATHLEEN
Claire, we need you for pictures.
(re. John)
Who's your friend?
CLAIRE
This is John Ryan.
JOHN
(to Claire)
You remembered my name. Very good.
CLAIRE
I have a gift.
She winks at him and walks away with Kathleen. Kathleen'turns 
around and winks at him too.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - BAR AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER 36 36
John enters the bar area. Jeremy walks up to him. He's 
eating.
JEREMY
You must try the bacon wrapped 
scallops.
JOHN
Will do.
(noticing a woman 
approaching)
Oh shit! Isn't that the chick you 
picked up at the Byrne Wedding?
JEREMY
(sees the woman, panics)
Quick hide me!
28.
JOHN
Too late. We’ll do number ten from 
the playbook.
She walks up.
WOMAN
Shlomo?! I thought you were 
renouncing your possessions arid 
moving to Nepal.
Jeremy looks at her, feigning confusion.
WOMAN
(continuing)
Shlomo? Don't you remember me?
JOHN
Oh, God, I'm sorry. You didn’t 
hear, I guess. Shlomo had a bad 
accident. In the Himalayas. 
Sherpas, pack mules. Oxygen 
deprivation. He doesn't remember 
anyone. Even me, his own brother. 
I'm just some nice man who helps 
him out.
WOMAN
Oh, you poor dear.
Jeremy looks at her and does fake sign language to John.
JOHN
(to the woman)
I'm afraid, he can't hear you. Part 
of the accident. You here for the 
Cleary Wedding?
WOMAN
Yes, but I have to leave. I've got 
a flight to Madrid.
Out of her sight, Jeremy mouths "Thank God" to John.
WOMAN
(continuing)
But I could hang out for a few 
minutes,
(stroking Jeremy's arm)
Oh, poor Shlomo.
Jeremy does more fake sign language.
JOHN
29.
He wants me to take him to the 
bathroom.
(off more fake sign 
language)
And he wants some crab cakes.
(to Jeremy, signing)
Okay, we'll go to the bathroom 
first then we'll get the crab 
cakes.
Jeremy signs angrily.
JOHN
(continuing; signing)
Fine. We'll get you the crab cakes 
first.
(to the woman)
Please excuse us.
WOMAN
(handing John a card)
Here’s my number if there's 
anything I can do to help.
The woman walks away. Jeremy grabs the card.
JEREMY
Cool. In a couple of weeks I'll 
have you call her for me. 
Guaranteed score. Deaf-mute 
amnesiac. They love that, I won't 
even have to buy her dinner.
JOHN
Charming. So what angle are you 
going to work here?
JEREMY
(looking around)
Oh -- I'll think I start with a 
public balloon animal display for 
the kids and then, when that chick 
draws near, do the man-haunted-by-
noble-past.
JOHN
Excellent.
JEREMY
You?
JOHN
30.
No brainer. I'm gonna work the Dad 
and then.dance with the little 
flower girl. Public policy minded 
and good with kids.
JEREMY
Beautiful.
JOHN
Let's do it.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER 37 37
Jeremy is making balloon animals for the kids. Presently, 
he's making an elephant. He hands 'the finished elephant to a 
kid. All the other kids are impressed. Jeremy looks around 
for Gloria, the bridesmaid he had "dibs" on at the ceremony. 
She looking at him from the corner of the room.
JEREMY
Okay, who’s next?
A BRATTY KID steps to the front of the crowd.
BRATTY KID
I want a bicycle.
JEREMY
A bike takes too many balloons. 
Uncle Jeremy's a little out of 
breath. How about a giraffe? 
Giraffe’s are cool.
The brattv kid gets right in Jeremy's face.
BRATTY KID
Make me a bicycle.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER 38 38
John is dancing with the Flower Girl who's counting her 
steps.
FLOWER GIRL
One, two, three, step. One, two, 
three, step.
JOHN
31.
Tell you what. Why don’t you just 
step on my shoes and I'll show you 
a few moves you can bust out on 
your classmates. Would you like 
that?
FLOWER GIRL
Yes, please.
She steps on John's shoes and he moves the Flower Girl around 
the floor like Gene Kelly. She's laughing and having the time 
of her life. Claire notices John and smiles at him. John 
smiles back and dips the Flower Girl, who's eating this up.
KATHLEEN CLEARY, the mother of the bride, steps in.
KATHLEEN
(to John)
Let's see how you do with someone 
your own age.
She's twice his age.
JOHN
I think I’m up to the challenge,
(to the Flower Girl)
Save me a dance later.
The Flower Girl smiles and walks away. John spins Kathleen 
around the dance floor.
JOHN
(continuing)
So, how long have you and the 
Secretary been married?
KATHLEEN
Oh, thirty years next April.
JOHN
Wow.
KATHLEEN
Ydah, and we were faithful for two 
of them.
She grabs Johns ass. CLOSE ON: John's stunned expression.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER 39 39
Jeremy hands an incredibly elaborate balloon bicycle to the 
bratty kid. Gloria walks up and notices the balloon.
32.
GLORIA
(to Jeremy)
You're good.
JEREMY
This is nothing. Yesterday I made 
my grandma a new house. Real nice 
one, too. With a pool.
Gloria laughs.
GLORIA
Okay, then I’ll take a sports car.
JEREMY
Or how about a dance instead?
GLORIA
That's what I really wanted.
Jeremy pulls Gloria out on the dance floor.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - CONTINUOUS 40 40
John is with Secretary Cleary.
SEC. CLEARY
You read my position paper on 
market expansion in Micronesia?
JOHN
Of course. Read it while I was 
sailing my boat to Bermuda.
SEC. CLEARY
Ah, a sailor. Good man. Hey, you 
didn't happen to catch my speech on 
the Paraguayan Debt and Money 
Supply issue, did you?
JOHN
Are you kidding me? It was 
brilliant. Now if only Congress 
weren't so short-sighted.
Secretary Cleary is thrilled by John’s praise.
SEC. CLEARY
Yes, yes! So short-sighted.
(putting his arm around 
John)
33.
John, what do you say you and I 
head out to the deck and light up a 
couple of cigars?
JOHN
Nothing would make me happier, sir.
INT, CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - CONTINUOUS 41 41
Jeremy and Gloria are dancing to a slower song.
GLORIA
And you saved his life?
JEREMY
Yeah, some others weren't so lucky. 
It still shakes me up to talk about 
it.
GLORIA
I’m sorry.
JEREMY
(a little choked up)
It's okay. It's just -- we lost 
some really good men.
Jeremy stops dancing and looks down, deep in thought.
JEREMY
(continuing; then)
If you'll excuse me. I think I need 
to get some air.
(shaking her hand)
It was nice meeting you.
Jeremy walks off towards the exit.
EXT. BEACH - A MINUTE LATER 42 42
Jeremy walks down toward the ocean.
GLORIA (O.S.)
Jeremy! Wait up.
Over Jeremy's shoulder, we see Gloria running to catch up to 
him. Jeremy smiles to himself. He's got her.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - DECK AREA - LATER 43 43

John and Sec. Cleary are out on the deck, smoking cigars, and 
looking out at the ocean.
SEC. CLEARY
John, you seem like an astute man.
JOHN
Thank you, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Maybe you can help explain 
something to me.
(nodding towards the 
corner of the deck)
See that young man over there?
John looks to see a young man, about 22. He’s an intense, 
morose, artiste.
He’s plucking petals off a rose and tossing them into the 
ocean, watching each petal intently as it falls. This is 
Secretary Cleary's son, TODD.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing)
That's my son, Todd.
(shaking his head)
Twenty-two years old. The whole 
world in front of him. Every 
advantage in life. Advantages I 
never had. Well, that’s not exactly 
true. He had the same advantages I 
had, which is a hell of a lot of 
advantages. So here's my question: 
what does he have to be so morose 
about? I don't know sir. Maybe he 
hasn’t found anything to believe in 
yet.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, he says he believes in --
(with disdain)
-- art. But all I’ve seen.him do is 
dribble his own blood on a canvas, 
then smear it around with a stick. 
Well, some people think that's art.
SEC. CLEARY
It's crap. Whatever happened to 
public service, our obligation to 
our fellow man?
(noticing a waiter, he 
holds up his glass)
35.
Um, Franklin. My daiquiri's at half 
mast.
FRANKLIN, the waiter, grabs the glass.
FRANKLIN
Right away, sir.
JOHN
I'm sure he's, you know, just 
finding his way.
SEC. CLEARY
And perhaps I should take it easier 
on him?
JOHN
Perhaps.
SEC, CLEARY
Yeah. Maybe your right,
TODD
(screaming out towards 
the ocean)
Death! You are my bitch lover!
SEC. CLEARY
Good, Todd, that's good! You tell 
that -- mean -- ocean.
John nods and smiles at Cleary.
EXT. BEACH - LATER 44 44
Jeremy and Gloria are siting in a deserted cove. She's 
completely smitten.
GLORIA
And so you dove into the icy water 
to save him?
JEREMY
Yeah, well, I'm sure anyone would 
do the same.
GLORIA
I’ve always wondered about this. 
It's so amazing to me. Why would a 
man risk his own life to save the 
life of someone he doesn't even 
know?
36.
JEREMY
Well, the great 19th century 
philosopher Schopenhauer asked that 
very question and this is how he 
answered it. He said that at that 
moment when a person sees another 
in danger, there is a breaking in 
of a metaphysical awareness. You 
know what that awareness is?
GLORIA
(expectantly)
What?
JEREMY
That we are all one. That 
separateness is an illusion. That I 
am one with everyone.
JEREMY
The Prime Minister of England, my 
great Uncle Harry, you, me, the fat 
kid on "What's Happening," We are 
all one.
GLORIA
We are?
JEREMY
Yes.
(taking her hand)
My hand -- is your hand.
(touching her cheek)
My cheek -- is your cheek.
(touching her lips)
My lips --
GLORIA
Are my lips?
JEREMY
Yes.
She kisses him passionately.
EXT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - DECK AREA ~ CONTINUOUS 45 45
John is still with Sec. Cleary. Claire walks up.
SEC. CLEARY
Claire, there's someone I want you 
to meet. This is John Ryan.
37.
CLAIRE
We've met. He's psychic.
SEC. CLEARY
Really? Well, maybe he can tell me 
where my daiquiri is.
(shouting)
Franklin! Oh, Franklin!
Sec. Cleary exits.
CLAIRE
You’re a big hit at this wedding.
JOHN
A lot of nice people here.
CLAIRE
Oh, they're full of shit.
JOHN
Excuse me?
CLAIRE
The only reason ninety-percent of 
these people are here is because of 
my Dad. They're all suckling at the 
power-teat.
JOHN
Yeah. Well, I’m here for the 
crabcakes and the power-teat. When 
is the suckling, by the way? After 
the first dance?
She laughs.
CLAIRE
I don't know. Everyone walking 
around trying to act like they 
care. It's awful. Plus the place is 
rife with lawyers. A gazillion 
lawyers.
JOHN
Not big on lawyers, huh?
CLAIRE
Hate 'em. I mean -- you're not one 
are you?
JOHN
38.
Oh God, no. But just out of 
curiosity, what have you got 
against lawyers?
CLAIRE
Lawyers are by nature liars. And I 
hate liars.
We see a few people slap Sec. Cleary on the back and share a 
laugh with him.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
See? Suckling.
John laughs. He’s finding Claire completely adorable.
JOHN
Maybe, but I think most people come 
to weddings, even this one, because 
they want to believe they're in the 
presence of true love, that true 
love is possible. Even the lawyers. 
And the sucklers.
CLAIRE
True love, huh? And what is "true 
love,” John Ryan?
JOHN
Well -- true love is your soul's 
recognition of it's counterpoint in 
another.
This obviously moves her, but she tries to wave it off.
CLAIRE
Well, that's a little grandiose.
JOHN
Perhaps. So are you giving a toast?
CLAIRE
Yes! Normally I'm terrible at these 
things, but I think this one's 
pretty good.
She hands John a piece of paper. He reads it over.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
I had to fight the urge to be 
completely honest. What do you 
think?
39.
JOHN
I think the urge won.
CLAIRE
What are you talking about?!
JOHN
You can’t say this.
CLAIRE
Why not?
JOHN
(reading, incredulously)
"I never thought my sister would 
find someone who cared about what 
people thought as much as she did. 
Until I met Craig."
CLAIRE
What?I It's funny. Funny because 
it's true. People like funny.
JOHN
No, see, the funny because-it’s-
true bit only works if the truth is 
a small thing like "Tim's a little 
frugal" or "We all know Jennifer 
likes to shop. Ha. Ha," I mean, 
people are here for a wedding, not 
to see Don Rickies at the Sands. 
I'd give it a fifteen, maybe a 
twenty percent chance of a laugh. 
Not worth it. See, people want 
something from the heart.
CLAIRE
(a little perturbed)
Well I think people are gonna love 
it.
JOHN
Nope, you're gonna get dead 
silence. Crickets.
CLAIRE
You're wrong. I'm going to stick 
with it.
JOHN
Fine. I'll be in the back of the 
room waiting to tell you I told you 
so.
40.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - BANQUET ROOM - LATER 46 46
The BEST MAN finishing up his toast.
BEST MAN.
But I think Bruce Springsteen said 
it best when-he-said, "Someday 
baby, I don't know when, we're 
gonna find that place where we walk 
in the sun." And I just want to say 
how happy I am that my best friend 
and the woman he loves have found 
that place. It's truly inspiring to 
us all.
An audible "aww" comes from the guests. They clink their 
glasses. John, standing in the back of room makes eye contact 
with Claire. John makes the gag sign. Claire stands up.
CLAIRE
I never thought my sister would 
find someone who cared about what 
people thought as much as she did. 
Until I met Craig.
Not a laugh in the place. In fact people are dismayed.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
As you all know both my sister and 
Craig are lawyers at big firms in 
New York. But that’s not the only 
thing they have in common. You see, 
they both have the same favorite 
color. Green.
(beat)
Uh -- like -- money? You know?
Again, not a laugh. The guests are starting to shift in their 
seats.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
Look, I'm sorry. I'm not really 
good at this sort of thing.
She looks to John, who points to his heart.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
41.
But I will tell you this. I’ve 
heard it said that true love is the 
soul’s recognition of it's 
counterpoint in another. That's a 
very rare thing in this world and 
it's something to be valued. And 
I'm just really happy that my 
sister has found it.
The guests-all say "aww.” The bride starts to cry, rushes up 
and hugs Claire. The guests applaud. Claire looks over at 
John who motions for her to meet him in the bar.
EXT. BEACH - SIMULTANEOUS 47 47
Jeremy and Gloria are under a blanket. They've just had sex.
GLORIA
That's was so amazing.
JEREMY
Yeah, great. What do you say we 
head back?
GLORIA
I always knew my first time would 
be on the beach. I'm just so happy 
it was you.
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. He gulps in fear.
JEREMY
Wait a minute. First time?
She nods.

John and Claire meet in the bar.
CLAIRE
Thank you!
42.
JOHN
Now you know never to doubt me.
CLAIRE
God, it was exhilarating. It was --
She leans in the hug John but before she can, SACK (one of 
the groomsmen) rushes up to her. Sack, early thirties, is 
great looking,. Ivy League, rich, works for noble causes. The 
guy every guy hates.
SACK
Claire, you were awesome.
Sack and Claire kiss. John is dumbstruck.
CLAIRE
John, this is my boyfriend, Sack.
JOHN
(halfheartedly)
Nice to meet you.
SACK
(to Claire)
Let’s dance.
CLAIRE
(to John)
It was great meeting you.
She shakes his hand.
JOHN
Yeah, you too.
John takes a big slug of his drink. Jeremy rushes up to him.
JEREMY
Dude, we’ve got to get out of here. 
ASAP. I've got a stage five 
clinger.
JOHN
I need more time.
JEREMY
You're not hearing me. She's a 
stage five! A virgin clinger! I'll 
start the car.
John is looking over at Claire and Sack.
JEREMY
43.
(continuing; off John's 
look at Claire)
Give it up already. Her sister told 
me she’s got a boyfriend. Tough 
luck. We all have our bad days. I 
need us to leave right now!
Secretary Cleary approaches with Gloria and his wife.
SEC. CLEARY
There you two are.
JEREMY
Actually -- we're about to leave. 
It's been a lovely wedding.
(to Gloria)
I'll call you. It’s a promise.
SEC. CLEARY
(ignoring Jeremy, to 
.John)
Well, look, we always hate to see 
the wedding end so we keep the 
party going back at our little 
place on the Vineyard. It's sort of 
a Cleary family tradition. And, 
well, since we've all taken a shine 
to you, we'd love you to be our 
guests for the weekend. What do you 
say?
Gloria smiles hopefully. Kathleen Cleary does the same. 
Claire and Sack approach the group. John looks at Claire.
JOHN
We'd love to.
JEREMY
What?I We don't have any other 
clothes!
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, we have everything you need out 
on the island.
JEREMY
But I promised my Granny I'd take 
her to the park.
GLORIA
And I'm sure daddy can hire 
somebody to take your Granny to the 
park.
44.
SEC. CLEARY
Not a problem.
JOHN
Great! Done.
John smiles. Jeremy starts to say something and John steps on 
his foot. Cleary slaps John on the back.
EXT. YACHT - THAT AFTERNOON 49 49
John, Jeremy and about fifteen others are on the Cleary 
yacht, a large expanse of boat, sailing toward Martha's 
Vineyard. John and Jeremy stand at the stern of the boat. 
Gloria approaches the guys.
GLORIA
Jeremy, sweetie, I’m making 
lemonade. Interested?
JEREMY
Sure, sure. That'd be great, honey.
She smiles and crosses away.
JEREMY
(continuing; sotto)
And could you put some heroin in 
it? John, this is against the 
rules! You've got a wedding and a 
reception tc seal the deal. Period. 
No overtime!
JOHN
Oh really? No overtime? Need I 
remind you of the Chung wedding, 
1997?
JEREMY
All right, look --
JOHN
We finished the reception. I'm 
ready to go home. Next thing you 
know, you're dragging me to watch 
you and some chick play mah-jongg 
with her grandmother thirty miles 
away at a retirement home.
JEREMY
I needed to do that, all right?!
JOHN
45.
You needed to do that -- ha.
JEREMY
She was into her grandma! You know 
the drill!
John scoffs.
JEREMY
(continuing; loudly)
It was my first Asian!
The people on the boat turn around and look at Jeremy John 
shoots him a look.
JOHN
Look, I just need some alone time 
with her.
JEREMY
She's got a boyfriend.
JOHN
They all have boyfriends. So what?
JEREMY
Okay. Fine. Get some alone time, 
seal the deal and let's get the 
fuck away from these people.
Sack walks over to them.
SACK
Gentlemen. Everything okay?
JOHN
Oh yeah. Fine.
Sack looks overboard.
SACK
Oh man, will you check that out. A 
school of bluefish.
John and Jeremy lean over to take a look.
SACK
(continuing)
46.
You know, these waters use to be 
flush with bluefish. And then the 
corporate polluters came in and 
well, you can guess the rest. After 
we, and I mean the National 
Environmental Defense League under 
my stewardship, got Massachusetts 
to pass the Bluefish Revival Act --
JOHN
Bluefish Revival Act? They were at 
Woodstock, right?
Sack laughs insincerely. William Cleary ambles over, cocktail 
in hand, and quickly looks overboard.
SEC. CLEARY
My God! Are those bluefish?
(then)
You know, Sack here is single  
handedly responsible for the spurt 
in the bluefish population.
Jeremy’s about to crack wise-ass but John elbows him.
JOHN
Yes we heard.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, anyway, listen, as soon as we 
get to the compound we were 
thinking about a little touch 
football.game. Sort of a Cleary 
family tradition. What do you say?
JOHN
Absolutely.
JEREMY
Great.
SEC. CLEARY
Good!
(examines his glass)
Damn, my daiquiri's at low-tide.
(looks overboard)
God, I love those bluefish.
Jeremy looks overboard. Cleary gives Jeremy a hard but 
friendly slap on the back and Jeremy falls into the ocean.

Jeremy is wet and shivering on the deck. As the boat 
approaches land, John and Jeremy can see the Cleary family 
compound on Martha's Vineyard. It’s a huge, old beachfront 
mansion with a large lawn and adirondack chairs strewn about. 
There's also a dock, housing various sailboats.
JEREMY
(sotto to John)
That's the "little place back on 
the Vineyard?"
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 51 51
Jeremy and John line up in a scrimmage with other guests 
including Claire, Cleary, and Sack. Todd, Claire's younger 
brother sits in a lawnchair on the sideline reading.
John hikes the ball to Jeremy and goes out for a pass. He's 
being covered by Sack. John fakes like he’s doing an "out" 
pattern but goes long. Sack, is completely fooled. rJohn 
catches the pass from Jeremy for a touchdown. John is 
congratulated by his teammates. Sack fumes.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - A FEW MINUTES LATER 52 52
John hikes the ball to Jeremy. Sack rushes in, aiming for 
John. He misses him and completely flattens Jeremy who 
manages to get the pass off.
ANGLE ON: John racing downfield. He reaches out to catch the 
pass, however Claire intercepts. She does a little pivot 
dance to get around John. John mimics her wildly. She laughs. 
He touch/tags her.
CLAIRE
Not fair’ You made me laugh!
JOHN
No, it's not fair. Yet a lot of 
things in life aren't fair.
He mimics her again. She laughs and looks upfield.
CLAIRE
Hey, is your friend okay?
ANGLE ON: A few people are dragging Jeremy’s seemingly 
lifeless body off the field. John runs over.
SACK
I don’t know what got into me.
48.
SEC. CLEARY
I do! Five generations of Lodge 
family breeding. Hell, your father 
used to pull the same stunt when we 
were your age.
Sack and Cleary share a laugh. John rushes over to Jeremy.
JOHN
Are you all right?
SEC. CLEARY
Oh he's fine! Hey, Jeremy, why 
don't you sit out the next play. 
Todd, come on in.
Todd looks up from his book.
TODD
You must be joking.
SEC. CLEARY
It wouldn't kill you to play some 
competitive sports once in a while, 
would it?
Todd scoffs. Cleary rolls his eyes.
JEREMY
(grabbing his side)
It's ok. It’s ok. Um, perhaps Todd 
could donate a kidney instead.
Gloria rushes over, hyper-concerned. She leans over him and 
sticks her tongue half way down his throat. Jeremy jumps up 
to get away from her.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Good, good. I'm better now. Second 
down.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - A MINUTE LATER 53 53
Different scrimmage. John is the quarterback. Jeremy hikes it 
to him as Sack comes in to rush. John whips the ball quickly 
to Jeremy who is pummeled and flattened by Sack.
SACK
Damn! What in the world is wrong 
with me?!
SEC. CLEARY
49.
Nature versus nurture, Lodge. 
Nature always wins.
They share another overly-exaggerated manly chortle.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing)
Let’s take a daiquiri time-out.
John walks over to Jeremy.
JOHN
You all right?
JEREMY
Um -- I may need you to perform the 
Heimlich maneuver. I think I'm 
choking on my own nuts. Do we get 
to leave now?
JOHN
No.
Gloria rushes over with her mother, Kathleen.
KATHLEEN
Honey, let's take him in the house 
and get him fixed up.
GLORIA
Sure, Mom.
Gloria helps Jeremy up who is practically concussive. They 
hobble into the house, leaving John alone with Kathleen.
KATHLEEN
(to John)
It's so hot out. Why don't you play 
in your underwear?
She gives him a long, flirtatious look.
JOHN
Umm --
KATHLEEN
Think about it. I'll make you a 
drink.
John stares at her perplexed as she walks off.
INT. CLEARY BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 54 54
50.
Jeremy is sitting on the edge of the tub in serious pain as 
Gloria applies mecurichrome to his wounds.
JEREMY
Ah man! That stings!
GLORIA
Ohhh, poor baby. Want me to blow -- 
on it?
JEREMY
It’s fine.
She gets on his lap. RANDOLPH, the early 40’s Jamaican butler 
passes by the open bathroom door. They don’t see him.
GLORIA
You know, I'm not wearing panties.
Randolph's shocked. He clears his throat. They look up. 
Gloria jumps off Jeremy's lap. Randolph speaks with a thick 
Jamaican accent.
RANDOLPH
Oh, don't worry, little Gloria. 
Mum's the word.
GLORIA
Thank you, Randolph.
RANDOLPH
A little more discreet though, 
okay?
Randolph shuts the door, shakes his head and walks away.
JEREMY
Oh Jesus --
GLORIA
Don't worry. He won't say anything. 
Now where were we? Oh right, I'm 
not wearing panties.
She starts to straddle him again.
JEREMY
It's like eight hours ago you were 
a shy virgin. Now you're not 
wearing panties?
GLORIA
(purring)
You do that to me.
51.
She starts kissing him. He moves her off his lap.
JEREMY
Gloria, look, I'm tired. It's been 
a long day. Not to mention that 
your sister's boyfriend made a 
smoothy with my nards. I'm not 
exactly in the mood.
GLORIA
(pissed off)
Fine.
She takes a swab of mecurichrome and stabs his wound.
JEREMY
Aaaaaarrrrrrrrgh!
GLORIA
My Father warned me about people 
like you! I'm just another notch on 
your belt!
JEREMY
No, no, it's not like that!
GLORIA
What's it like then, Jeremy?! Huh?! 
Huh?!
JEREMY
It's like --
She takes another load of medicine and tortures another 
wound.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Aaaaaaaarrrrrrgh!
(quickly)
Ok, ok. It's like you're so, uh, 
damn precious that I would -- uh -- 
feel like -- uh -- I'm using you if 
we took every opportunity to 
express our -- love -- in a 
physical way. It diminishes the 
poetry of this thing that we have.
She melts into his arms.
GLORIA
You're my knight, in shining armor.
JEREMY
52.
Cool. Good. Good.
GLORIA
Don't ever leave me.
JEREMY
Oh no. Never. Don't you worry --
GLORIA
Good.
(beat)
Because I'll find you.
They get up. Jeremy's stressed. They exit into the hallway.
INT. CLEARY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 55 55
Jeremy and Gloria pass Sec. Cleary.
SEC. CLEARY
Get him all patched up, Glory-bug?
GLORIA
I sure did, Daddy.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, you go change for dinner.
She gives Jeremy a peck on the cheek and walks away.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing)
You really seem to make her happy, 
son.
JEREMY
Oh well -- yeah.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, she's my youngest and I spoil 
her a bit. I can only hope you 
treat her honorably. You know, 
she's not just another notch on the 
ol' belt.
JEREMY
Oh no, no. Of course not, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Good, good. Because that would make 
me angry in ways you cannot 
possibly imagine.
(beat)
53.
And I'm a very powerful man.
JEREMY
Right -- yes, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Yeah --
(pondering)
Boy, I wish to Christ we could get 
her off that mood medication. Oh 
well, see you downstairs for 
dinner.
Cleary walks away. Jeremy is now horrified.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY DINING ROOM - LATER 56 56
An opulent dinner for fifteen is in the process of being 
served. Cleary is at the head of the table. His mother 
GRANDMA MARY, a woman who looks nearly 100, sits next to him. 
The rest of the family, Sack, and the other guests fill out 
the table. Randolph, the Jamaican butler, stands nearby.
John and Jeremy enter the alcove just outside the dining 
room. John looks at Sack. He’s holding court. John’s 
nauseated.
JOHN
(intense but sotto)
Jer, you have the visine?
JEREMY
No’ Not the visine! It’s too early!
JOHN
I need the visine, goddamit. Give 
it to me!
JEREMY
You know the rules. The visine is a 
last resort. The visine's a fucking 
felony.
JOHN
I can't get any alone time with 
her. The guy won't leave her side. 
I need the visine.
JEREMY
54.
The visine's fucking hard-core. A 
few drops in his drink and he’ll 
spend the next twenty-four hours 
going down on a toilet seat, puking 
his guts out.
ANGLE ON: Sack at the dinner table.
SACK
-- so when I picked up the little 
sea otter and wiped the oil off him 
from the tanker spill, I swear he -
- smiled. It was a little -- otter 
smile. You know, all teeth, the 
whiskers kind of pert --
ANGLE ON: Jeremy and John. Jeremy reaches into his pocket.
JEREMY
Okay, here's the visine.
John and Jeremy enter the dining room.
SEC. CLEARY
Here they are!
They sit down near the head of the table. Gloria has saved a 
seat for Jeremy right next to her.
FATHER O’ NEIL
Heavenly Father --
Everyone bows their heads. John quickly squirts the visine 
into Sack's wine.
FATHER O’ NEIL
(continuing)
We thank you for the bounty on this 
table and ask you bless our family 
and friends here assembled. In the 
name of the Father, the Son, and 
the Holy Spirit. Amen.
They all make the sign of the cross. Jeremy, preoccupied, 
doesn't until John nudges him. Randolph walks over with a 
platter and sets it on the table.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, these scallops look fantastic.
SACK
I brought them from an organic 
scallop farm right off Nauggesett.
55.
CLAIRE
(proudly)
Yeah, Sack talked the Governor into 
subsidizing part of the project.
SACK
Yup. Now, it's the state’s only 
self-sustaining scallop farm.
JOHN
Say that five times fast.
Claire laughs, then stops herself.
JEREMY
(pointedly to Sack)
I bet they’re tasty. Maybe I'll try 
them when my jaw heals.
SACK
Again, I'm sorry, Jeremy. It's that 
damn competitive streak. I’m seeing 
a Buddhist about it.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, not just any Buddhist. His 
Holiness the Dalai Lama. He’s a 
friend.
JEREMY
Really? I'm seeing a orthopedist 
when I get back to-town. Not just 
any orthopedist. Dr. Epstein --
JOHN
(sotto, to Jeremy)
Enough, ok?
(to Sack)
He’s just fooling around. So how 
long have you and Claire been 
together, Sack.
SACK
Uh -- I don't know. What's it been, 
Claire? A couple of years?
CLAIRE
Three and a half.
(to John and Jeremy)
We started dating while we were 
doing that Habitat for Humanity 
thing.
Sack smiles.
56.
SACK
Anyway, John, tell me how you're 
connected to the family again?
JOHN
Uncle Ned's kids.
JEREMY
You know -- Uncle Ned? The brother 
of -- Aunt Liz?
John and Jeremy bow their heads and make the sign of the 
cross.
SACK
(suspicious)
Uh-huh --
We see Gloria reach her hand under the table and grab 
Jeremy's crotch. Jeremy's eyes bug out. He tries to push her 
arm away. Gloria, her arm hidden by the table cloth, begins 
to furiously masturbate Jeremy.
SEC. CLEARY
So John and his brother here are 
venture capitalists.
JEREMY
(falsetto)
That’s right)
John looks at him strangely, then looks down. He sees what's 
happening and gives Jeremy a shocked look.
SEC. CLEARY
That's great. The venture 
capitalist. The backbone of the 
system. The new pioneer.
CLAIRE
So is it just about money?
Sack feigns disgust.
JOHN
Oh -- no, no! Not at all. It's 
about, you know, investing in 
projects that are both ethically 
and morally defensible.
SACK
Like what, for example?
JOHN
57.
(making this up as he 
goes along)
Like what? Oh, you know, we’ve got 
company that, uh, takes the wool 
from sheep and uh, and turns it 
into thread for the homeless people 
to sew -- into cloth and then make, 
you know shirts and pants to sell 
at a profit. Everybody wins.
CLAIRE
Cool --
SACK
Mmm. What’s it called?
Jeremy is near climax.
JEREMY
(falsetto)
Holy sh --
JOHN
(quickly)
Holy Shirts And Pants.
The group nods approvingly. Oleary's wife Kathleen looks at 
John and licks her lips seductively. John’s horrified. Sack 
reaches down and feels his stomach. Something’s-wrong.
SACK
I don't feel so good.
SEC. CLEARY
(ignoring Sack)
That’s a hell of a good project. 
Let me mention something to the 
Commerce secretary.
JOHN
Great, great.
GRANDMA MARY
Isn’t my Willy doing a wonderful 
job there in Washington?
JOHN
Oh yes, Ma’am.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh Mommy --
KATHLEEN
(sarcastically)
58.
He still calls his mother "Mommy." 
Isn't that cute?
Kathleen slams down her wine and pours another. Gloria is 
finished with Jeremy. She giggles. Jeremy is spent.
GRANDMA MARY
The President is so proud of my 
Willy.
GLORIA
(sotto, to Jerdmy)
I’m so proud of yout willy.
Jeremy, shocked, takes a drink of water.
GRANDMA MARY
You know, Willy's predecessor was a 
Jew.
Jeremy spits up his water.
SEC. CLEARY
Mommy, let's not go there. Saul 
Rothstein was a good man.
GRANDMA MARY
Maybe so.
(beat)
For a Jew.
CLAIRE
Grandma, you can't talk that way. 
You can’t feel that way. It's not 
right!
SEC. CLEARY
(to the table)
Mommy’s a little old-fashioned.
JEREMY
(sotto, to John)
Yeah. Like Hitler.
GRANDMA MARY
What did you say his name was 
again, Willy? Hymie Bergstein? I 
always forget his name. Bur. my 
God, did he have a nose on him.
Jeremy's aghast. It’s like he's eating with the Gestapo.
CLAIRE
Grandma!
59.
GRANDMA MARY
Well, you could have used it to 
flip pancakes. It was like a 
spatula. I mean you could write the 
Ten Commandments on each side of 
that thing.
JOHN
(to Grandma Mary)
Ma'am, I have to tell you I happen 
to have a lot of very good friends 
who are Jewish. As does my brother.
JEREMY
Very close to the Jews.
GRANDMA MARY
(how dare you?!)
Really?
JOHN
Yes. Really.
CLAIRE
(to John)
Thank you. Finally someone speaks 
up.
SEC. CLEARY
Of course. We all have Jewish 
friends! Nothing wrong with that.
GRANDMA MARY
Well I guess you have to now, 
especially if you're doing anything 
in finance. They own all of that. 
Can somebody bring me' another 
sherry?
Randolph pours her another sherry. She downs it while holding 
onto the butler's sleeve. She makes him pour another.
Sack grabs his stomach. He’s turning green.
SACK
I’ve gotta go.
He stands up.
CLAIRE
What's wrong, honey?
SACK
Gotta -- go.
60.
Sack bolts from the table.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh dear. Hope he’s okay --
JOHN
Well, there’s a lot of flu going 
around.
JEREMY
But his eyes are sure clear.
John elbows Jeremy. John, passes a platter to Todd.
TODD
Oh, I don't eat meat or fish.
GRANDMA MARY
(beat, sweetly)
He's a homo.
CLAIRE
Grandma!
GRANDMA MARY
What? He can't help it. They say 
it’s genetic.
(indicating Kathleen)
From her side of the family.
Todd's head sinks. Jeremy gives him a sympathetic pat on the 
arm. Todd looks at Jeremy -- lovingly.
CLAIRE
(changing topic)
Todd's an amazing painter. He's 
going to the Rhode Island School of 
Design.
JOHN
Wow. That's very impressive.
TODD
Dad used to think I was a political 
liability, you know, in case he 
ever ran for President.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh Todd.
(to John)
Well, actually, truth be told, 
polling shows a majority of the 
American people would ultimately 
empathize with our situation.
61.
TODD
What is "our situation," Dad?!
GRANDMA MARY
You're a homo.
KATHLEEN
Oh, for Chrissakes, William. Put 
Mommy to bed already!
SEC. CLEARY
Okay. Mommy, we’ve had a long day.
Cleary motions over Randolph, who helps Grandma Mary up.
GRANDMA MARY
I can do it myself, asshole.
Grandma Mary, clearly drunk, shuffles off. Todd, pissed off, 
gets up and storms off.
TODD
I'll be in my room. Painting -- 
homo things.
KATHLEEN
You go right ahead, Toddy.
JOHN
(to Claire)
So maybe after dinner we could take 
a walk?
CLAIRE
How about now? I can’t take this 
anymore. They're driving me crazy.
JOHN
Great! Let me just change my shoes.
CLAIRE
Irll be outside waiting. Hurry up.
JOHN
Absolutely.
Claire gets up and hastily exits. John looks at Jeremy and 
winks. He gets up and exits in the opposite direction.
INT. GUEST ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 57 57
62.
John is sitting on the bed putting on some top-siders. We 
hear the door open and then shut. John looks up. We see 
Kathleen Cleary. She's topless. John gasps.
KATHLEEN
I just got my tits done.
JOHN
(jaw agape)
Uh-huh.
KATHLEEN
Do you like them?
JOHN
Uh, yes. Those -- are great -- 
tits.
KATHLEEN
William doesn't appreciate my tits.
JOHN
Well, darn him. Mrs. Cleary, I 
don't think --
KATHLEEN
Call me Kat.
JOHN
Okay, Kat, I don't think that --
KATHLEEN
Call me Kitty-Kat.
JOHN
Uh, look -- Kitty-Kat -- I really 
don’t think this is appropriate --
She walks toward John and stands right over him.
KATHLEEN
Feel them.
JOHN
What?!
KATHLEEN
I said feel them.
JOHN
Mrs. Cleary --
KATHLEEN
Kitty-Kat.
63.
JOHN
Kitty-Kat, are you out of your 
fucking mind?
KATHLEEN
I'm not letting you out of this 
room until you feel them.
John sighs. He reluctantly reaches up and feels her breasts.
JOHN
They're very nice. Okay?
She moans deeply. She grabs her blouse and buttons it up.
KATHLEEN
We will be lovers before this 
weekend is up.
She blows him a kiss and exits. John shakes his head; what 
the hell just happened?
INT. HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER 58 58
John is walking down the hallway. He passes Todd's room. 
Todd’s painting. He sees John.
TODD (O.S.)
Mom make you feel her tits?
John stops and backs up.
JOHN
What?! No!
TODD
It's okay. I can tell. You have 
that "Mom made me feel her tits" 
look on your face. Don't worry 
about it. She usually picks one 
male guest a weekend to sexually 
harass.
JOHN
Oh Jesus --
TODD
Don't say anything to Dad, though. 
Some friend of my sister said 
something to Dad a couple of years 
ago and he now lives in Paraguay. 
And not by choice.
64.
JOHN
Good to know.
TODD
No problem --
John hurriedly continues down the hall. He runs into Jeremy, 
shuffling down the hall looking completely spent.
JEREMY
What's wrong?
JOHN
Nothing. I'm just trying to get 
outside to meet Claire.
JEREMY
You've got a weird look on your 
face.
JOHN
(through gritted teeth)
Claire's Mom made me grope her 
boobies, okay?!
JEREMY
Hmm. She get them done? They look 
pretty good.
John stares at him a beat.
JOHN
What's wrong with you?
John continues on down the hall.
JEREMY
What? I just asked --
JOHN
Shut up!
JEREMY
(calling out to him)
You go enjoy yourself! I'm just 
gonna go spit up some blood and ice 
down my balls.
Jeremy enters his room.
INT. JEREMY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 59 59
65.
Jeremy enters his guest room. Immediately he sees Grandma 
Mary sleeping in his bed. He thinks he’s walked into the 
wrong room, but notices his cumberbund and jacket hanging 
over the chair. He goes over to the bed and gently nudges 
Grandma. She looks at him and screams. Jeremy screams.
GRANDMA MARY
What do you want?
JEREMY
You're in my room.
GRANDMA MARY
Oh dear. I am. Too much sherry. Can 
you carry me to my room?
JEREMY
What?
GRANDMA MARY
I think I'm too drunk to walk.
JEREMY
Uh, okay, sure.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - SIMULTANEOUS 60 60
John steps outside to meet Claire.
CLAIRE
What took you so long?
JOHN
I’m sorry. I got --
(searching for word)
-- held up.
CLAIRE
Strange family, huh?
JOHN
Yeah -- a little.
(beat)
So where should we go?
Sec. Cleary pokes his head out the door.
SEC. CLEARY
Claire, Sack was asking for you.
Claire looks at John.
CLAIRE
66.
(to Sec. Cleary)
Could you tell him I’m busy?
SEC. CLEARY
He's in pretty bad shape.
CLAIRE
(grudgingly)
All right -- I’m coming.
Cleary nods and goes back into the house.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
Sorry, John. Maybe we can find time 
tomorrow.
JOHN
Yeah, sure, tomorrow then.
Claire starts to head back into the house.
JOHN
(continuing)
Hey, help him get better soon -- I 
saw some otters earlier and they 
were -- frowning.
CLAIRE
(smiling)
Be nice.
Claire exits into the house. Cleary pokes his head back out.
SEC. CLEARY
John, my boy. Brandies? Den?
JOHN
Yeah. Great. I'll be right in.
John looks up at the sky, frustrated by his missed "walk with 
Claire" opportunity.
JOHN
(continuing)
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
EXT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 61 61
Jeremy’s carrying Grandma down the hall.
GRANDMA MARY
You’re very strong.
67.
She giggles, than falls asleep. We see Randolph poke his head 
out of his room, and obviously misinterpret what's going on.
JEREMY
(to Randolph)
Oh, uh, okay -- I know this looks 
kind of strange --
RANDOLPH
You're bangin' the daughter and the 
grandma?! How much jam you got, 
mon?
JEREMY
No no! It's not like that!
RANDOLPH
Listen, mon. The family dog lives 
downstairs. I can wake him up for 
you, too, if you like.
JEREMY
Look, you've got it totally wrong!
RANDOLPH
Just be gentle wit her, mon. Okay? 
She be pushing ninety.
Randolph returns to his room. Jeremy stands there 
dumbfounded.
INT. RANDOLPH’S ROOM - CONTINOUS 62 62
Randolph shakes his head, lights a bong and takes a monster 
hit.
RANDOLPH
(to himself, while 
exhaling)
Good God. It's a mutter-fucking 
freak show here --
INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 63 63
Jeremy is laying in bed tossing and turning. He's sore.

John is laying in bed, eyes open, wide awake.
68.

Sack is laying on the bathroom floor. He pops up to retch 
into the toilet.
INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 66 66
Claire is laying in bed, and like John, she's wide awake.
INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 67 67
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. He's asleep. We see two legs straddle him. 
He awakens with a jolt.
JEREMY
Hey!
Pull back to reveal Gloria. She starts tying his right arm to 
the bed post.
JEREMY
(continuing)
What are you doing?!
GLORIA
Listen, I know what you were saying 
before and I started thinking that 
maybe I'm not being exciting and 
adventurous for you.
She ties his other arm to the bed post.
JEREMY
Gloria --
GLORIA
Sssh. You'll wake everybody.
(beat)
I'm going to make all your 
fantasies come true.
JEREMY
But --
She takes a sock and stuffs it in his mouth.
JEREMY
(continuing; muffled)
This is not my fantasy!
She puts duct tape over his sock-filled mouth.
69.
GLORIA
I love you --
INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 68 68
John is walking down the hallway. He comes to Claire's door 
and listens to see if she's awake.
INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 69 69
Claire is laying in bed, eyes open, wide awake.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 70 70
John doesn’t hear anything. He sighs and walks away.
INT. HALLWAY - AN HOUR LATER 71 71
Claire walks down the hallway to John's bedroom door and 
listens for him. She sighs and walks away.
INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 72 72
John is sitting by the window staring out.
INT. GRANDMA MARY'S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 73 73
Grandma is tossing and turning. She's muttering to herself.
GRANDMA MARY
What was his name? Mitch Jewstein? 
No -- that’s not it. Samuel 
Kikeberg? No -- that's not it --
INT. JEREMY’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 74 74
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. He’s sleeping again. We see a hand come in 
from out of frame and gently stroke his forehead. Jeremy 
slowly awakens.
JEREMY
(half-asleep)
Gloria -- you have to go back to 
your room.
TODD (O.S.)
It’s not Gloria.
70.
Jeremy gasps. We pull back to reveal Todd, naked, on his 
stomach stroking Jeremy's forehead,
JEREMY
Jesus Christ!
TODD
We had a moment at the dinner 
table, didn't we?
JEREMY
What are you talking about?! There 
was no moment.
TODD
Oh yeah, we had moment.
JEREMY
I was sitting right there. I think 
I would have noticed a moment --
TODD
I made you a painting.
Todd picks up a flashlight and shines it on a painting 
resting on Jereiny's dresser. We see a siirreal red mess 
blotched onto the the canvas.
TODD
(continuing)
I call it "Tortured Scrotum." It's 
sexual and violent. Sort of a self-
portrait. I thought you'd like it.
JEREMY
Oh wow -- that's, uh, something. 
Thank you -- so -- much.
TODD
Oh you're more than welcome.
Todd kisses Jeremy on the forehead.
JEREMY
Say listen, Todd, I haven't gotten 
much gosh-darned sleep tonight and 
hey, why don't we talk tomorrow?
TODD
Promise you'll make time for me?
JEREMY
Oh -- cross my heart.
71.
TODD
Okay -- you sleep.
Todd gets up, kisses his finger and puts it on Jeremy's Lips.
JEREMY
Okay. Good enough.
Todd smiles and exits. Jeremy, shaken, looks upward.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Lord! How much more of this can I 
take?I
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING 75 75
John is at the breakfast table, eating some bacon, reading 
the newspaper, drinking coffee in a gargantuan kitchen. 
Jeremy stumbles, exhausted, into the kitchen. A COOK is 
making all kinds of breakfast things. He pours Jeremy some 
coffee and exits.
JOHN
You know they’ll make you anything 
you want here? Waffles, bacon, 
whatever --
JEREMY
Oh that’s swell, John.
JOHN
What’s your problem?
JEREMY
What’s my problem? Oh, I didn't 
sleep too well.
JOHN
Why not?
JEREMY
Well, besides the bone-crushing 
pain and the midnight rape, there 
was a nude gay art show at 4 a.m.
JOHN
(ignoring Jeremy, reading 
paper)
Phew. Red Sox are taking it in the 
shorts.
Jeremy pulls the newspaper down.
72.
JEREMY
I'm taking it in the shorts!
JOHN.
Have some toast.
JEREMY
I'm too traumatized for toast!
Nonetheless, he grabs a piece off John's plate.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Look, I'm going to say.this as 
nicely as possible: if we don't get 
the fuck out of here right now I'm 
going to kill you.
JOHN
Can't do it.
JEREMY
Why not?!
JOHN
I need another day.
JEREMY
(loudly)
For what?! She's got a boyfriend. 
Plus, her own mental hospital here 
to entertain him!
JOHN
Sssh! Keep it down! I think 
Claire's into me. Plus, the 
boyfriend's a complete tool.
JEREMY
Okay, we think the boyfriend's a -- 
tool. Maybe the whole world thinks 
the boyfriends a tool. But if she's 
doesn't think the boyfriend’s a 
tool then the game's over.
JOHN
The game's never over.
JEREMY
John, the rules are really clear 
about boyfriends and --
JOHN
73.
Will you stop it with the rules, 
already? ! Fuck the rules!
JEREMY
(hurt)
“Fuck the rules?” How can you say 
that?! You’re a very insensitive 
man.
JOHN
This isn't about the rules, okay?! 
This is about love!
JEREMY
Love?!
(deep breath)
Well -- okay. The rules do in fact 
make provisions for what we delude 
ourselves into thinking is love.
JOHN
Oh Jesus --
JEREMY
Come on! How can it be love? You've 
known her for a day.
JOHN
I don't know, Jeremy. I can't 
explain it. Chemical? Fate? I don't 
know. I just know!
Jeremy stares at him for a beat.
JEREMY
Fine. I understand. I'm outta here. 
Good luck.
Jeremy starts to stand. John pulls him back down.
JOHN
No, no, no. You can’t leave!
JEREMY
Why not?!
JOHN
Because that’ll create a huge 
shitstorm with Gloria! It'll focus 
the attention there!
JEREMY
74.
I don't give a baker’s fuck! I had 
my own sweat sock duct-taped into 
my mouth last night!
(off John’s look)
Long story.
JOHN
I need you to help me. I mean what 
do the rules say about abandonment?
JEREMY
(grudgingly)
"Never leave a fellow crasher 
stranded. Wedding crashers take 
care of their own."
JOHN
That’s right.
JEREMY
I hate you --
JOHN
Have some more toast.
JEREMY
(sighs)
I want a waffle.
JOHN
Good! That’s good.
(calling out to the cook)
Can we get this man a waffle?
John smiles and slaps Jeremy on the shoulder.
INT. SACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 76 76
Sack, looking haggard, reaches for the phone. He dials and it 
rings. We cut between he and his friend TRAP MITCHELL.
EXT. MITCHELL HOUSE - INT. SACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 77 77
Trap Mitchell, sipping a gin and tonic in a palatial Cape Cod 
backyard, picks up the phone.
TRAP
Hello?
SACK
Trapster, it’s Sack.
75.
TRAP
Sack-Master! What’s the word? How 
was the wedding?
SACK
It was great. Fine. Whatever. 
Listen, I need background on two 
guys the Secretary invited out here 
for the weekend. John and Jeremy 
Ryan.
Trap writes the names down.
TRAP
Okay, John and Jeremy Ryan.
SACK
They're brothers. A couple of 
venture capital weasels from New 
Hampshire. Got some kind of NPO 
called Holy Shirts and Pants.
TRAP
Oh -- venture capitalists, they’re 
the worst.
SACK
Tell my girlfriend's father. He 
practically shot his cabinet level 
wad over these two.
TRAP
It's all about the money with guys 
like that. Sick, sick, sick.
SACK
Preaching to the choir, brother.
TRAP
Hey, listen when you get a chance 
you need to come into the firm so 
we can restructure your trust fund.
SACK
Oh right, right. Will do.
TRAP
And I'll look into these guys -- 
see what their story is.
SACK
76.
Excellent, bro. Hey listen, let's 
get the guys together later on this 
month. Do some sailing, drinking, 
etcetera, etcetera --
TRAP
Sounds good. I'll call Skunk and 
Twine.
SACK
Cool. I'm seeing Billygoat on 
Tuesday so Г ’11 tell him.
TRAP
You da' man.
SACK
You da' bigger man.
They laugh. They’ve done this before. It's nauseating.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY DOCK - THE NEXT MORNING 78 78
John and Jeremy walk to the Cleary family sailboat. On the 
side of the boat is painted "The Kathleen." Secretary and 
Mrs. Cleary, Gloria, Claire, and a few other guests are on 
the boat already. Sec. Cleary is at the helm, preparing to 
sail.
SEC. CLEARY
Where's Sack?
CLAIRE
I don't know --
JOHN
Poor guy's probably still not 
feeling well. That flu usually 
lasts about two days.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, then, "The Kathleen" takes 
off without him.
Sack comes running from the house.
SACK
Wait! I'm coming.
JOHN
Oh good. Here he comes.
(sotto, angry, to Jeremy)
How old was that visine?!
77.
Sack gets to the dock. We see that he's had a really rough 
night. As he gets on the boat, he shoots John a dirty look.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY SAILBOAT - LATE 79 79
They're out in the ocean. Secretary Cleary is at the helm, 
steering the boat. Sack sits next to Claire, his arm tightly 
around her. John and Jeremy sit on the bow of the boat. 
Gloria's arm is tightly around Jeremy.
CLAIRE
Are you all right, honey? Maybe you 
should go down in the cabin and lie 
down.
SACK
No, I'll be fine. So, John, where'd 
you say you guys were from up there 
in New Hampshire?
JOHN
I didn't. But we're from 
Manchester.
SACK
Great town.
JOHN
Big city with a small town heart.
SACK
A college buddy of mine moved up to 
Manchester. He loves the place. ’ 
Maybe you know him. Skunk Baker?
JOHN
Sorry. Big city. Small town heart. 
But still a big city.
CLAIRE
Anyone want a beer?
Sack nods "no."
JOHN
Sure, I’ll take one.
Claire gets up and goes into the cabin of the boat.
SACK
78.
You sure you don't know Skunk? He's 
the big guy with Chase up there. 
Surely in your line, you’ve come 
across each other.
Sack really doesn't look well. With each rock of the boat, he 
gets a little more queasy. John notices this and gets an 
idea.
JOHN
Hey, you know my buddy Dave's with 
Chase. I bet he knows him.
(then)
Too bad Dave's not here. You'd love 
him. Of course, you'd never catch 
Dave on a boat again. We went out 
on a boat one time and you should 
have seen how sea-sick he got. I’m 
telling you, it was a mess. We'd 
all eaten a bunch of Lobster Rolls 
and Dave likes his just slathered 
in mayonnaise. I mean he ate, like, 
three of them.
Sack is starting to turn green.
JOHN
(continuing)
And a bunch of corn chips. Great 
guy but he eats like a sea otter.
Sack is trying not to lose his lunch.
JOHN
(continuing)
We’re not out to sea five minutes 
before this guy blows like 
Krakatowa. I mean, it’s everywhere. 
It was like reliving the whole 
lunch.
Sack bolts to the cabin. As he does, he crosses Claire who’s 
coming back on deck with two beers.
JOHN
(continuing; to Claire)
Poor guy. He should've stayed home.
Claire hands John a beer. He takes a sip and stares pensively 
off to sea. He's trying to get her to ask him what he's 
thinking about. He takes a dramatic sip of beer.
CLAIRE
79.
Being out in tige ocean. It makes 
you realize how insignificant you 
really are, huh?
JOHN
Yeah, I guess we are.
CLAIRE
No, no. I mean you.
JOHN
Very funny.
She smiles at him.
CLAIRE
Actually, that's why I hate the 
ocean.
JOHN
(looking around to make 
sure no one1s listening)
Me too! I hate anything that comes 
on like it's bigger than me.
CLAIRE
Exactly. The ocean has an attitude 
and I don't like it.
(mimicking)
"I'm the ocean. I'm so vast and 
eternal and you're so small and -- 
not eternal."
JOHN
Which is a very nasty attitude,
(beat)
You know what else has a nasty 
attitude? The stars.
CLAIRE
I know. They're rude! And the 
mountains- -
JOHN
Oh, don't get me started on the 
mountains.
They share a laugh then look at each other for a beat. 
There's the flicker of a moment.
INT. CABIN BELOW DECK - CONTINUOUS 80 80
Sack hears John and Claire laugh and pukes into a bucket.
80.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY SAILBOAT - CONTINUOUS 81 81
John and Claire continue their conversation.
JOHN
You know what I like? Tide pools. 
No attitude from a tide pool.
CLAIRE
There are some amazing tide pools 
over on the other side of the 
island. We could bike over there 
this afternoon, if you like.
JOHN
I'd like that. It's a date.
SEC. CLEARY
(holding empty glass)
John, my daiquiri's swimming in the 
shallow, end. Take the helm.
JOHN
(lying)
Sure. No problem,
SEC. CLEARY
Just start tacking back.
John, having no clue, gives Jeremy a panicked look. Jeremy 
shrugs.
JOHN
Of course. Tack back. I was gonna 
tack back. Excellent choice, the 
tacking back.
Sec. Cleary lets go of the helm and starts for the cabin. 
John grabs the wheel. Kathleen comes up behind John and grabs 
his -- mast.
JOHN
(continuing)
Tacking!
John turns the wheel too quickly and the boat reacts 
suddenly, sending the main sail flying around and smacking 
into Jeremy. Jeremy flies into the ocean.
GLORIA
Jeremy!
81.
Gloria jumps into the water. In trying to rescue Jeremy, 
Gloria is so overwrought and panicked that she keeps dunking 
him back into the water. He’s gasping for breath.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY DOCK - A LITTLE LATER 82 82
The boat has docked. Everyone is disembarking. Gloria is 
holding Jeremy who’s wrapped in a blanket. John pulls Claire 
aside.
JOHN
What do you say we hit those tide 
pools?
CLAIRE
Sounds great.
Randolph approaches the group. He’s carrying several rifles, 
which he begins handing out to all the men, including John 
and Jeremy.
RANDOLPH
Everything's ready for the quail 
hunt. There’s a jeep waiting to 
take you to the marsh.
SEC. CLEARY
Wonderful, Randolph.
JOHN
Uh, maybe, I’ll sit this one out.
JEREMY
Yeah, I think we’ll sit this one 
out.
SEC. CLEARY
Nonsense. I insist. It's a Cleary 
family tradition.
CLAIRE
(to John)
I'm afraid you're stuck. We’ll 
check out the tide pools later.
Sack takes note of this and scowls.
SEC. CLEARY
Sack, if you're too sick --
SACK
(determined and a little 
crazed)
82.
Oh, no. He ha. I’m going. Oh, I’m 
going!
Sack grabs a rifle. He's starting to look a little scary.
JEREMY
(to Sack)
You hunt?!
SACK
I hunt quail. They're overpopulated 
on the island. They're decimating 
the grub worm population. Got a 
problem with that?!
JEREMY
(a little frightened)
Hey, it’s all good.
EXT. MARSH - A LITTLE LATER 83 83
A group of about ten men, including Sack, Sec. Cleary, John 
and Jeremy walk through the marsh looking for quail. Jeremy 
stops and pulls John aside.
JEREMY
Have you ever shot one of these 
things before?
JOHN
Oh you bet. The whole fifteen years 
we've known each other? Well, I’ve 
been sneaking out to shoot at small 
birds.
(beat)
Of course I've never shot one of 
these things!
JEREMY
What are we gonna do? I don't want 
to kill a quail. It's bad karma.
JOHN
You'll lie to young women to get 
them in bed but you won't shoot a 
little bird?
JEREMY
Right.
JOHN
Yeah, me too. But look, j.ust aim 
to miss.
83.
Secretary Cleary stops and points.
SEC. CLEARY
There. Off to the left.
Everyone aims.and shoots. John and Jeremy fumble to get their 
rifle in shooting position. When it discharges, they're sent 
flying five feet on their asses.
EXT. MARSH - A LITTLE LATER 84 84
The men are still, walking through the marsh. Jeremy is 
rubbing his shoulder.
JEREMY
I thought the rifle just fired 
buckshot.
JOHN
Yeah. That's lead pellets, 
dumbfuck. It's’not a sling-shot.
JEREMY
Thank you.
Sack stops and points.
SACK
There. Over by the spruce tree.
As everyone turns, we see Sack set his sights on John. 
Through Sack's scope, we can see John's ass. The men fire. 
Jeremy discharges his rifle. He's sent reeling again. This 
time into John. Sack shoots his rifle. But instead of hitting 
John, he hits Jeremy. Jeremy hits the ground grabbing his 
ass.
JEREMY
My ass!
INT. CLEARY FAMILY BATHROOM - LATER 85 85
CLOSE ON: Jeremy’s ass. Someone is pulling out buckshot with 
tweezers. Pull back to reveal it's Gloria. John and Claire 
poke their heads into the bathroom.
JOHN
You okay, buddy?
JEREMY
Just fucking great!
84.
JOHN
(to Claire)
He’s never been a silent sufferer.
(to Jeremy)
We're gonna take the bikes out for 
a ride. We'll catch you later.
JEREMY
Yeah sure. You kids go and have a 
good time.
(worked up)
I'll just be here getting lead 
pellets pulled out of my heinie!
John and Claire exit. CLOSE ON: Jeremy. Gloria starts groping 
Jeremy, then looks disappointed.
GLORIA
Awww. Mr. Pogo isn’t jumping up --
JEREMY
Well, sorry, Mr. Pogo gets stressed 
when Mr. Jeremy’s bleeding to 
death, okay?
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - LATER 86 86
John and Claire are riding bikes on a path near the shore.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 87 87
Sack pops into the living room. Randolph is sitting on the 
couch watching TV.
SACK
Hey Randolph?
RANDOLPH
Sssh. I'm watching my stories, mon.
SACK
I just need to know where Claire 
is.
RANDOLPH
Uh -- she and that fellow went for 
a bike ride to the tidepools.
Sack’s jaw clenches.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - TIDE POOL - LATER 88 88
85.
John and Claire stop their bikes at the edge of a tide pool.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - SIMULTANEOUS 89 89
Sack pedals furiously on an old bike with a little basket on 
the front. He looks a lot like the mean lady in the beginning 
of the Wizard of Oz.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - TIDE POOL - LATER 90 90
John and Claire exploring the tide pool.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - SIMULTANEOUS 91 91
Sack is still pedaling like a lunatic. A man walks his dog 
down the road. Sack rings the old-fashioned bike bell 
aggressively and nearly runs over the mari and his dog.
EXT. MARTHA1 S VINEYARD - TIDE POOL - LATER 92 92
John picks up a bi-g starfish and tries to put in on Claire's 
head. She splashes him. They're laughing.
Sack pulls up on his bike and watches John and Claire from 
the hill above the tide pool.
John splashes her back. Soon they are in the midst of a 
splashing frenzy, getting closer.to each other with each 
splash. They end up in each other's arms. Claire looks up at 
John who's looking back at her intently.
JOHN
So, it would be a total cliche if I 
kissed you right now, right?
CLAIRE
Yes. A total cliche.
She pulls him in and kisses him.
ANGLE ON: Sack watching them.
SACK
(to himself, utterly 
disgusted)
Fuck.
Sack pedals away quickly.
ANGLE ON: John and Claire. Claire breaks the kiss.
86.
CLAIRE
I can't do this.
Claire runs off and gets on her bike.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 93 93
Everyone is seated-at the table mid-meal. John tries to make 
eye contact with Claire but she turns away. Jeremy is 
shifting uncomfortably in significant ass pain. Grandma Mary 
is sound asleep, clutching a glass of sherry, snoring loudly. 
Sack taps his glass for attention. Everyone stops talking and 
listens.
SACK
Claire and I have an announcement 
to make. We were going to wait to 
tell all of you, but the spirit of 
this weekend is such that we can’t 
think of a better time to share our 
good news.
SACK
(looking right at John)
Claire and I are going to be 
married.
Everyone oohs, ahhhs and applauds except John, who is 
stunned. Claire looks at Sack, perplexed.
SEC, CLEARY
Wonderful!
KATHLEEN
(slurred)
Wonderful!
Grandma Mary pops awake.
GRANDMA CLEARY
(drunk, out of it)
Is the war over?
She slumps back down. Everyone ignores her.
CLAIRE
(through gritted teeth to 
Sack)
Sack -- we need to talk about this.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, I am thrilled! Isn't this 
wonderful, Randolph?
87.
RANDOLPH
(droll, insincere)
Oh, it's a marriage blessed by the 
angels, made in heaven, mon.
(beat)
Okay, who wants sherbet?
Gloria stands up. She's beaming.
GLORIA
Jeremy and I have anannouncement to 
make, too. I'm going to be Mrs. 
Ryan!
Oohs, ahhhs, applause.
JEREMY
What?!
KATHLEEN
(slurred)
Wonderful!
Jeremy puts-his head in his hands. Grandma Mary pops back up.
GRANDMA MARY
Roosevelt's a pussy!
Claire gets up and exits outside.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY DINING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 94 94
Some of the guests are hovering around Gloria, the rest 
around Sack. John is sullen. Jeremy pulls him aside.
JEREMY
(to John)
Oh well, game over. Thanks for 
playing. Maybe they'll have parting 
gifts. I’ll get my shit, we'll get 
out of here.
John thinks for a beat, then takes a deep breath.
JOHN
You know what? I'm just gonna find 
her and tell her the truth.
JEREMY
The truth?! Okay. That might be a 
good call. You’re the. Prince of 
Arabia, you've rejected the throne 
--
88.
JOHN
Jeremy! The actual truth.
JEREMY
Oh. Wow. Okay,
(frustrated)
Fine. Do whatever you want. Just do 
it quick, all right?
John bolts outside. Jeremy looks out the window. From his 
POV, we see John rushing after Claire. Jeremy shakes his head 
and exits into the kitchen.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 95 95
Jeremy hobbles in, grabs a hand towel, walks to the freezer 
and fills the towel with ice which he places gently on his 
wounded ass. The COOK, stifles a laugh and exits.
JEREMY
(calling after her)
It's not funny!
Jeremy sits-down on the ice pack and puts his head on the 
table. Gloria walks in.
GLORIA
There you are!
JEREMY
Oh, hey, Gloria --
She opens a magazine in front of his face.
JEREMY
(continuing)
What's that?
GLORIA
It's a china pattern, silly. It's 
called Midnight Marakkesh.
JEREMY
Oh that's really nice --
GLORIA
Excellent! It's sexy and you can 
eat off it. Just like me.
She winks and exits. Jeremy moans. Father O’Neil walks in and 
sees Jeremy, head in hands, ass in ice.
FATHER O’ NEIL
89.
Well, hello there.
JEREMY
Oh, hello Father.
FATHER O' NEIL
Are you okay? You look troubled.
He sirs down next to Jeremy and pours himself a brandy.
JEREMY
Ah, you know --
FATHER O’ NEIL
Marriage is a big step. You sure 
you're ready?
JEREMY
Oh, gosh, uh, sure -- I'm ready,
FATHER O’ NEIL
C'mon, Son. What’s on your mind?
Jeremy looks out the kitchen window and sighs deeply. He's at 
the end of his rope.
JEREMY
I'd like to make a confession.
FATHER O' NEIL
All right, Son. I can hear your 
confession.
JEREMY
It's all confidential, right?
FATHER O' NEIL
Huh?
JEREMY
I mean, you know --
FATHER O' NEIL
You haven't been to church in a 
long time have you? Of course. It’s 
all confidential.
JEREMY
Well, see, that’s just it. I'm not 
a Catholic.
FATHER O' NEIL
Pardon me?
90.
JEREMY
I'm a Jew.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY LIVINGROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 96 96
Sack is sitting on the couch, a few people around him. His 
cell phone rings. Trap is on the other end and we cut back 
and forth between them.
TRAP
Sackster.
SACK
Trapster.
TRAP
Listen, about those guys --
EXT. BEACH - A MINUTE LATER 97 97
John is following Claire down the beach. She's walking at a 
brisk pace.
JOHN
C'mon Claire, wait up.
She continues walking.
JOHN
(continuing)
So -- you’re 'marrying this guy, 
huh?
She stops and turns around.
CLAIRE
Is that what you want to know? 
Well, you heard it back at the 
house.
JOHN
Look, you can't marry him.
CLAIRE
Why not?
JOHN
Um -- because I’m falling in love 
with you.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS 98 98
91.
Jeremy's really comfortable with the Priest. He's kicking 
back, confessing.
JEREMY
(mid sentence)
-- and my bar mitzvah had a Return 
of the Jedi theme which in 
retrospect I regret -- but anyway, 
the point is we're not venture 
capitalists. We're lawyers. And we 
do this, I mean we crash weddings 
in order to, uh --
FATHER O' NEIL
Meet girls?
JEREMY
Yes, yes. Well, actually more than 
meet them. We, you know, hope to 
have sex with them. And, hey, if 
the band’s good and the spread's 
decent, that's just bonus points.
FATHER O' NEIL
And did you "meet" anybody from the 
Cleary wedding?
JEREMY
Actually, I slept with Gloria. 
Well, I didn't actually sleep with 
her.
JEREMY
We did it once at the beach at the 
wedding and then she --
(makes the jerk-off 
motion with his hand)
-- at the dinner table. There was 
one more time. But I was not a 
willing participant, okay?
(off Priest's look)
Long story.
FATHER O' NEIL
And your friend? With Claire?
JEREMY
No, no. Get this! He thinks he's in 
love with her! Isn't that 
hilarious? See? That’s why we've 
been here so long! Normally we're 
in and out in a couple hours and --
FATHER O' NEIL
92.
Okay, okay. I get it.
JEREMY
Did I mention Todd has a crush on 
me?
FATHER O' NEIL
No, sadly you left that out.
JEREMY
Oh well, he does. He pretty much 
made that obvious after he gave me 
a self-portrait of his testicles.
(beat)
Phew! This felt great. Thank you! I 
think you guys might really have 
something with this confession 
business.
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 99 99
John is facing Claire who's looking out toward the ocean.
CLAIRE
Why are you doing this to me, John?
JOHN
But, you -- maybe feel the same 
way?
CLAIRE
(sighs)
Maybe.
(beat)
Look I don't know anything about 
you. You do investments in New 
Hampshire and --
JOHN
Well, see, that's the other thing.
We hear a loud gunshot come from the direction of the house.
CLAIRE
Oh my god!
JEREMY (0.5.)
Dude! Run!
JOHN
What the hell?!
93.
They look back and see Jeremy being chased by Secretary 
Cleary, Kathleen, Todd, Sack, and Grandma who's holding a 
large shotgun firing willy-nilly at Jeremy.
GRANDMA MARY
He's a Jew!
She*fires off a round and misses. Jeremy screams.
SEC. CLEARY
You bastards! I’m going to get you!
Jeremy catches up with John.
JEREMY
Get the fuck outta here! Run!
JOHN
What’s going on?!
Jeremy continues to run.
JEREMY
(shouting back at John)
I spilled! I’m sorry. The Priest 
told me it was confidential!
FATHER O' NEIL
I’m sorry. God doesn't pay the 
bills.
CLAIRE
He spilled what?!
JOHN
Oh fuck! Look, Claire, I need to 
tell you something quickly.
SACK
They're lawyers, Claire. Those 
weren't even their real names!
GRANDMA MARY
Get back here, Jew!
Grandma fires off another round which barely misses John
JOHN
(to Claire)
I'll explain later.
John runs down beach toward Jeremy.
KATHLEEN
94.
John felt my tits!
SEC. CLEARY
Goddamit! Get 'em. Mommy!
Grandma fires another round.
SACK
They crash weddings in order to get 
laid!
Claire is mortified. John turns around and looks defeatedly 
at Claire.
JOHN
Claire, you don't understand!
CLAIRE
(very upset)
No, no, no. You son of a bitch!
TODD
Jeremy was going to be my lover!
(yells to Jeremy)
You’re not keeping my scrotum 
painting!
GLORIA
I forgive you, Jeremy! Come back!
Grandma fires off another round as John and Jeremy tear down 
the beach over some rocks and out of sight. We see the Cleary 
family slowly give up the chase.
EXT. FERRY - A LITTLE LATER 100 100
John and Jeremy get on the ferry as it’s taking off. In 
frustration, John kicks a bench, then sits down, forlorn.
EXT/INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 101 101
Montage:
John walks dejectedly through the streets of Boston.
Claire walks in a similar manner along the beach on Martha's 
Vineyard.
John mails a letter addressed to Claire.
John gets his mail. His letter has been returned unopened.

Sack shows Claire some honeymoon brochures. She smiles at him 
than stares pensively out the window.
Gloria mails a letter, addressed to Jeremy.
Gloria gets her mail. Яег  letter has been returned unopened.
John, in a single man crew boat, is rowing frantically down 
the Charles River trying to catch up to Claire who’s in her 
own boat. She doesn't see him. The wake from a large crew 
boat pitches John’s boat over, sending him flying into the 
Charles.
Sack and Claire are on the beach. Sack tickles a sea otter 
underneath its chin. She puts her arm on Sack and smiles. The 
sea otter bites Sack’s leg.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - THREE WEEKS LATER 102 102
John, a bounce in his step enters Jeremy’s office. He's 
holding the paper.
JOHN
Jeremy, I know how I can get to 
her.
JEREMY
Give it up. She's returned all your 
letters, she won’t take your calls. 
She doesn't want to see you, all 
right.
JOHN
She doesn't think she wants to see 
me. But trust me, she wants to see 
me.
JEREMY
Okay --
JOHN
They're having an engagement party 
for her tonight at the Beach Club. 
We’re gonna be there.
JEREMY
We're? No.
JOHN
I need you to be my wing man.
JEREMY
96.
Look, John, her father is the 
Secretary of the Treasury. There's 
gonna be Secret Service. They'll 
probably have posters with our 
pictures on them. There's no way we 
can get in there.
JOHN
Oh yes we can.
Jeremy gives him a skeptical look.
EXT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - ALLEYWAY - THE NEXT DAY 103 103
John and Jeremy stand at the rear of the restaurant.
JEREMY
How'd you find out about this?
John smiles and gives a coded knock on the door. RANDOLPH 
opens the door.
RANDOLPH
Finally! Okay, mon, I got your 
uniforms.
Jeremy stares at Randolph in disbelief.
RANDOLPH
(continuing)
What are you staring at, mon? 
Sack's a tool.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT 104 104
John and Jeremy are dressed as waiters. John is making 
coffee. The kitchen has two doors. One leads to the dining 
room. The other leads to the banquet room where the Cleary's 
are having the engagement party. MICHAEL, the dining room 
captain walks in. Michael is clearly gay and a bit drunk with 
power.
MICHAEL
(to Jeremy)
Table five needs their soup. Muy 
pronto!
JEREMY
So? They're not my table. I haven’t 
even started yet.
97.
Michael is shocked at Jeremy's insolence. He struggles to 
regain his composure.
MICHAEL
Okay. Who am I?
Jeremy shoots John a look.
JEREMY
You're the captain.
MICHAEL
That's right. Which makes me--?
JEREMY
(exasperated sigh)
Always right.
MICHAEL
That's right sweet-cheeks. Now get 
table five their soups. Comprende?
JEREMY
Yes.
MICHAEL
Yes, what?!
JEREMY
Yes, Captain.
Jeremy ladles two bowls of soup, puts them on a tray, and 
exits into the dining room.
MICHAEL
(to John)
And you? Are we working -- working 
or are we, oh, just soaking in the 
atmosphere?
JOHN
Yes, Captain. I’m making coffee. 
That’s my assignment.
MICHAEL
Like your attitude.
(beat, winks)
Let’s talk later.
Michael exits into the banquet room.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 105 105

Jeremy is talking to table five, an ELDERLY COUPLE.
JEREMY
Fine, i'll get you the chowder 
instead.
ELDERLY MAN
The Boston chowder!
JEREMY
I know --
ELDERLY MAN
The white one --
JEREMY
I said I know --
ELDERLY MAN
Not the red one!
JEREMY
I get it.
Jeremy picks up their soups and puts them back on his tray. 
He exits back into the kitchen.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 106 106
Jeremy enters and puts the soups down and ladles two bowls of 
chowder. He gives John the finger and exits with the chowder 
into the dining room. John opens the door that leads to the 
banquet room a little to sneak a peek. He sees several Secret 
Service guys.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - DINING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER 107 107
Jeremy is with table five. Their chowder is on the table.
ELDERLY WOMAN
You put ice in my water!
JEREMY
It’s ice water. That's part of the 
deal.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I don't want ice.
JEREMY
Okay --
99.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I don't know why you put ice in my 
water.
JEREMY
Because I'm not psychic?
The old woman scowls at him.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Okay, you don't want ice?
He picks up her glass and takes out the ice with his hands.
JEREMY
(continuing)
There. No ice!
ELDERLY WOMAN
(taken aback)
I'm talking to the manager!
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 108 108
Jeremy enters to find John peering through the door.
JEREMY
Hurry up. Talk to her. I can take 
about five more minutes of this 
shit.
JOHN
I've got to wait until she's alone.
JEREMY
It's an engagement party! Why would 
she be alone?!
JOHN
She’s got to go to the bathroom 
sometime.
Michael enters.
MICHAEL
Lester, may I have a word with you?
John nudges Jeremy.
JOHN
(sotto)
That’s you.
100.
Jeremy, remembering he's going by "Lester," walks over to 
Michael.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - BANQUET ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 109 109
JOHN'S BOV: Claire and Sack are talking to some guests. 
Claire looks beautiful, of course,
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - DINING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 110 110
Jeremy is with table five. His head is sunk. He's mid 
apology. Michael is standing right behind him, arms folded.
JEREMY
-- and again, I am deeply sorry for 
my offensive words and terrible 
attitude.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - KITCHEN. - A MINUTE LATER 111 111
John peeks out the door. Suddenly he sees Claire walk, toward 
the restroom. He starts to go out after her, but Michael 
enters and blocks his way. Claire enters the restroom.
MICHAEL
Sergio, what are we supposed to do 
with cranberry torte?
JOHN
(still eyeing Claire)
What?
MICHAEL
I said what are we supposed to do 
with the cranberry torte?
JOHN
Uh -- drizzle it with Grand 
Marnier?
MICHAEL
That's right. And what did you do?
JOHN
I drizzled it with Grand Marnier --
MICHAEL
(screeching)
101.
You drowned it in Grand Marnier! I 
nearly had to perform mouth to 
mouth! The little cranberries were 
in there screaming, "Oh help us! 
We're drowning in'an alcohol bath!"
Claire exits the bathroom. John starts out of the kitchen.
JOHN
Excuse me, Captain. Table three 
needs a --
We see Sack walk up to Claire and escort her back to the 
banquet room. John's lost his chance.
JOHN
(continuing; to Michael)
I'll, uh, drizzle next time --
MICHAEL
Please do.
Michael exits haughtily. John's sighs.
INT. CHATHAM EEACH CLUB - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 112 112
Jeremy walks by table five.
ELDERLY MAN
I need a soup spoon.
Jeremy stares at the table. There’s a soup spoon sitting 
right there. He decides not to say anything. He starts to 
walk away but his pride and anger get the best of him.
JEREMY
(beside himself)
I-I-I'm sorry.
(picking up a spoon)
What’s this?
ELDERLY MAN
That's not a soup spoon.
JEREMY
Well it's not a coke spoon!
He picks up the man's teaspoon.
JEREMY
(continuing)
See? Teaspoon, soup spoon! Tea 
spoon, soup spoon! Jesus Christ!
102.
ELDERLY MAN
Well now’you've touched it! I need 
another!
JEREMY
(yelling)
Get it yourself, you decrepit old-
money cocksucker!!
The whole restaurant gasps.
JEREMY
(continuing; yelling)
Does anyone else need anything? 
Because I'm gonna take my break.
Jeremy starts to exit into the kitchen. The Secret Service 
guys rush into the dining room to see what the fuss is about. 
Sack, Claire and Sec. Cleary are with them. They see Jeremy 
who's bee-lining it for the kitchen. Gloria starts to enter 
but Secretary Cleary gently pushes her back to the private 
room.
SEC. CLEARY
(to Claire)
Take care of Gloria.
Claire is torn and hesitates.
SACK
Do it, sweetheart! Please!
Claire follows her sister back into the private room.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 113 113
Jeremy enters the kitchen.
JEREMY
(to John)
Okay. We're gonna want to run now.
John sees Sack and the Secret Service guys enter the kitchen.
JOHN
Oh not again!
SACK
(to the Secret Service)
These are the guys I warned you 
about.
The Secret Service, guys grab John and Jeremy.
103.
SACK
(continuing)
No! Let me handle it!
EXT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - PARKING LOT - A FEW MINUTES LATER 114 114
A guy, TRAP MITCHELL, is holding John while Sack pummels him. 
The other has Jeremy pinned to the ground. Sec. Cleary looks 
on.
SEC. CLEARY
Now if I see either of you anywhere 
near my daughters again, I will 
have you arrested! I have that sort 
of power and I won't hesitate to 
use it.
Secretary Cleary storms off.
TRAP
(to Sack)
One more, Sackmaster, and then we 
have to finish up dinner.
Sack slams John in the gut, spits on him and he and the Trap 
go back into the restaurant, leaving John and Jeremy in the 
parking lot. John sits up and rubs his jaw. Jeremy dusts 
himself off. He looks at Jeremy, disgusted.
JOHN
Nice job.
JEREMY
Oh? You didn't care for my 
performance as a waiter? Okay, well 
don't go to the fucking sequel, all 
right?
John shakes his head. He takes off his torn jacket and gets 
up. So does Jeremy.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Dude, look, she’s just not worth 
it.
John stares at him for a beat.
JOHN
You know, that’s what you said 
about Mary Theresa Spinolli.
JEREMY
104.
What?!
JOHN
Mary Theresa Spinolli? Your Junior 
Prom date?
JEREMY
I know the story! I had to remind 
you of the story!
JOHN
Mary Theresa Spinolli was cheating 
on you with every guy in high 
school! You were in love with her! 
She broke your heart!
JEREMY
Are you fucking high? That was 
fifteen years ago!
JOHN
Mary Theresa Spinolli was your 
first love and she broke your 
heart! And because you had to be a 
man, because we all have to be 
"men," all you had to say about it 
was "she's just not worth it."
JEREMY
Okay, I think you have a 
concussion.
JOHN
Problem was you couldn't move on. 
And since then, none of them have 
been worth it! Right, Jeremy?!
JEREMY
You're an asshole.
JOHN
And now, because of that, we all 
have to pay the price!
JEREMY
What price is that, John?!
JOHN
Not growing up! Okay?! Pissing away 
our fucking lives living by some 
idiotic dumb-ass "rules!” Not 
growing up, Jeremy --
JEREMY
105.
You could've opted out anytime, my 
friend! Nobody held a gun to your 
head!
John doesn't answer.
JEREMY
(continuing)
This life -- crashing weddings, 
picking up women -- this life fits 
you perfectly. And you know why? 
Because you're a chronic liar.
JOHN
Fuck you.
JEREMY
See, crashing weddings, pretending 
to be someone you’re not to get 
laid? You don't do that in spite of 
who you are. You do that because of 
who you are! Don't get me wrong. 
It's a compliment. You're a genius 
at bullshit. That's why you're so 
good in the court room. And that's 
why you’re so good at crashing 
weddings. It's who you are.
JOHN
I'm outta here.
John starts to walk away but stops and turns.
JOHN
(continuing)
All those weddings we went, to over 
the years. Didn't you once look at 
how happy the bride and groom were 
and wonder what that would be like?
JEREMY
No.
JOHN
I feel sorry for you.
John starts to leave. Jeremy grabs his arm.
JEREMY
106.
At least I know who I am, 
motherfucker! You? Hell, you can 
talk about love, love, love until 
you're blue in the face. But in the 
morning you still have to wake up 
as John. Full of shit John.
John clenches his fist and is about to belt him. Then he 
takes a breath, sighs and backs off.
JOHN
You know what? You're just not 
worth it.
John turns and walks away.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - TWO MONTHS LATER 115 115
Decorations and trays of food are out. Everybody’s drinking. 
It's a party. A banner reads: "Farewell John. Good Luck in 
Chicago." We see a group of John's colleagues toast him. John 
raises his glass and smiles. He takes a drink and casually 
looks around. Jeremy's nowhere to be seen.
INT. JEREMY'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS 116 116
Jeremy is at his desk. It's dark, save for one lone dim lamp. 
Jeremy takes a drink. He's obviously unhappy.
INT. JOHN’S APARTMENT - A FEW DAYS LATER 117 117
John is packing up boxes, getting ready to move. Jeremy 
bursts in.
JEREMY
Okay, don’t say anything! Not a 
word. Let me just say this. What 
you said outside the beach club? It 
was true. I mean, about thirty 
percent of it.
(off John's look)
Okay it was all true. I haven’t 
grown up and -- I am covering for 
some -- pain. And -- I don't know. 
Look, I'm sorry I fucked up the 
Claire thing for you.
JOHN
You didn't fuck up anything.
Jeremy smiles.
107.
JOHN
(continuing)
Well, I mean you did, but it wasn’t 
your fault. How could I ever expect 
to woo the woman of my dreams by 
crashing a wedding? It’s 
ridiculous.
JEREMY
Well, we did have fun -- at all of 
them.
JOHN
No doubt, my friend.
They look at each other and embrace.
JOHN
(continuing)
I just need to make a new start. 
Preferably in a state where I'm not 
under a restraining order.
JEREMY
Yeah, I get that. It’s just I was 
thinking we should go out one more 
time before you leave.
JOHN
Yeah. That'd be great. What do you 
want to do?
JEREMY
Well, there's a wedding --
JOHN
Jeremy --
JEREMY
Come on. For old times' sake.
JOHN
No way. I'm done with that.
JEREMY
This’ll be the last one! A send 
off. Do it for me. Fifteen years of 
friendship --
INT. BOSTON CHURCH - LATER 118 118
John and Jeremy enter the church. They stop in the back.
108.
JOHN
You know this is the last time I'm 
doing this, right?
JEREMY
Absolutely.
A wedding is in progress. John looks up at the altar. It's 
Claire and Sack's wedding. He looks at Jeremy. Jeremy smiles.
JOHN
I don’t think I can do this --
JEREMY
Sure you can. She's the woman of 
your dreams.
JOHN
Oh man --
JEREMY
It’s your big moment. Dazzle the 
jury.
John looks at Jeremy.
JOHN
Thanks.
JEREMY
You'll want to hurry up. I think 
they’re getting pretty close to the 
"I do" part. Which would be bad.
John walks toward the altar. He clears his throat loudly. All 
eyes turn to him.
JOHN
Excuse me.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, for the love of God!
He motions security over. Grandma Cleary stands up.
GRANDMA CLEARY
It's the Jews!
SACK
Security!
The Secret Service approach John.
JOHN
109.
Just let me speak my mind and I'll 
leave you all alone forever.
Sec. Cleary nods "okay" to the security men.
SACK
(sotto to Claire)
I don’t fucking believe this.
JOHN
Claire, it’s true, I met you 
because I crashed your sister's 
wedding.
(to the guests)
That's right. I crash weddings. Or 
at least I used to. In fact --
(pointing to a couple)
I crashed your' wedding about a 
year ago. Very nice, by the way. I 
will say a vegetarian option is 
usually a good idea but, otherwise, 
a wonderful wedding. How's it going 
for you by the way?
They nod "pretty good." From the back of the church, Jeremy 
clears his throat as if to say, "Pick it up.”
JOHN
(continuing)
And, yes, it’s true I'm a lawyer. 
But my heart's not in my law 
practice. I mean, I've tried to do 
good. Well, that hasn’t always been 
true and, well, I've lied -- a lot.
Everybody shifts uncomfortably. Jeremy clears his throat 
again.
JOHN
(continuing)
All right, all right! My point is 
I’ve changed. I guess I've grown up 
and I don't know why it took me so 
long but, well, maybe it's because 
I didn't see anything worth growing 
up for and now maybe I do and look, 
I don't know -- I'm sorry. I’m 
usually pretty articulate but -- I 
guess it's a lot harder when you're 
not bullshitting.
(to the Priest)
Sorry Father.
Father O’Neil nods "don't worry about it."
110.
JOHN
(continuing)
Yes, I was. a liar. I was a liar 
because I was scared. But you know 
what, Claire? You’re scared too. 
You're scared to tell the truth 
about Sack. You're hot in love with 
that bozo.
Sack turns crimson.
SACK
Okay, I've had enough.
He starts to moves off the altar. Claire holds his arm.
JOHN
In fact, I think you might be.in 
love with me. I know I'm in love 
with you. In fact, I love every 
single thing about you -- except 
for the fact you’re on that altar 
with another man.
John starts to walk toward the altar.
JOHN
(continuing)
But, Claire, I’ve made a change in 
my life because of you and maybe 
you'd like to make a change because 
of me.
Claire looks at Sack and then looks at John. A long beat and 
then she smiles at Sack, She leans to him. He smiles. We 
think she’s going to kiss him. Their lips are about to meet.
CLAIRE
I'm sorry, Sack.
She takes off her veil and steps, off the altar. Sack looks 
at Secretary Cleary as if to say "help me."
SEC. CLEARY
Claire!
Claire turns around.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing; beat, then 
smiling)
I’m sure you and John will be very 
happy. At least try to be, okay?
111.
SACK
Oh, you've got to be kidding!
SEC. CLEARY
Lodge, you’re a tool. In fact, you 
come from a long line of tools. I 
suppose you're maintaining the tool 
tradition -- but not with my 
daughter.
Sack glares at Sec. Cleary, then bolts off the altar. He's 
running straight for John but before he can get there, Jeremy 
runs up from the back of the church and tackles him.
JEREMY
(to Sack)
Oh sorry, dude, I don't know what 
got into me. I’m seeing a Buddhist 
about it.
Claire runs up and hugs John. They begin rushing out of the 
church.
JOHN
Thanks, buddy.
JEREMY
My pleasure.
Gloria's noticed Jeremy for the first time.
GLORIA
Jeremy!
She runs toward him.
Todd stands up, runs toward a man in the first row and hugs 
him.
TODD
Senator Frankel!
There's total chaos in the church. John and Claire kiss. They 
run out of the church.
EXT. CHURCH STEPS - CONTINUOUS 119 119
John and Claire look at each other and smile.
JOHN
Where to?
CLAIRE
112.
I'm starving --
JOHN
Me too. What're you in the mood 
for?
We see Jeremy being chased by Gloria, ten feet behind them.
CLAIRE
I don’t know. Maybe Japanese.
JEREMY
(calling out)
Fujimora wedding! Salem. Three p.m. 
Great tempura.
Jeremy keeps running. John and Claire shake their heads and 
laugh. A wedding guest who’s late, walks up with a gift in 
her hand and perplexedly hands it to Claire.
CLAIRE
(to John)
Place setting.
JOHN
Oh yeah.
She hands the gift back. John and Claire look at each other, 
kiss and keep running.
DISSOLVE TO:
CHYRON READS: ONE YEAR LATER
INT. HOUSE OF WORSHIP - ONE YEAR LATER 120 120
CLOSE ON: John and Jeremy. They're in tuxes. We see just a 
touch of the altar behind them. The Wedding March begins to 
play. John’s a little nervous. They have a sotto 
conversation.
JEREMY
Dude, you ready for this?
JOHN
Yeah, yeah -- of course.
JEREMY
Because you seem nervous --
JOHN
I’m fine, I'm fine.
(beat)
113.
It's just that I've never been a 
Best Man before.
We pull back to see Gloria walking down the aisle with 
Secretary Cleary.
JEREMY
Dude, you’re going to be a groom 
next month!
We see Claire, the Maid of Honor standing with other 
bridesmaids. John smiles at her. She smiles back.
JOHN
Oh, that I can deal with. Watching 
you do this, different story.
Jeremy laughs. Gloria gets closer.
JEREMY
You know, we're going to be 
brothers-in-law.
JOHN
I know.
JEREMY
Well, you know, the rules for 
brothers-in-law are different. When 
Chazz Reinghold got married, he 
said --
JOHN
Wait! What do you mean "When Chazz 
Reinghold got married?!" You never 
told me he actually got married!
Gloria's-nearly at the altar.
JEREMY
(sheepish)
Oh -- yeah -- well he tied the knot 
last year.
JOHN
I can't believe you didn't tell me 
that?!
JEREMY
I guess I forgot --
JOHN
Bullshit.
114.
CLAIRE
(sotto)
Boys! Enough!
JOHN
(to Jeremy)
We’ll talk about this later.
Secretary Cleary gives Gloria a kiss ana. shakes Jeremy's 
hand. Jeremy beams as he sees Gloria, radiant, John smiles 
and pats Jeremy pn the back. Jeremy starts toward the altar 
where we see a Priest and a Rabbi.
JEREMY
(to himself)
Shoot! I forgot.
Jeremy takes out a yarmulke ahd puts it on.
CLOSE ON: Grandma Mary. She rolls her eyes.
As Jeremy is about to step up to the altar he turns to John.
JOHN
(whispering)
Dude, row seven, five and six seats 
in.
John turns around. He sees two guys in their early twenties. 
They're both gently dabbing their eyes. John turns toward 
Jeremy and smiles.
JOHN
(continuing; sotto)
Crashers.
JEREMY
Oh yeah.
John chuckles and gives the guys a nod. Jeremy walks up to 
the altar. He and Gloria smile at each other, as we:
FADE OUT:
