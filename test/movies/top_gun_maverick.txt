EXT. CARRIER DECK - DAWN 1 1
FIGHTER JETS roll on the silhouetted deck as FLIGHT CREWS 
work their technical ballet. Men and women devoted to detail 
and duty, preparing their warriors for the arena. All the 
while, MUSIC builds over OPENING TITLES as jets LAUNCH into 
the sky, afterburners blazing, roaring like thunder...
EXT. CARRIER ELEVATOR - DAWN A3 A3
AN F-18 silhouetted against the morning sky, rising to the 
main deck. A HELMET edges into frame, bearing red white and 
blue stripes along with the name: MAVERICK.
BOOM UP TO REVEAL the man holding the helmet, his back to us, 
his head turned slightly. Something troubles him. Deeply. 
MAVERICK 
Talk to me, Goose...
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Captain Mitchell.
And as the pilot turns we MATCH CUT TO:
INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY A12 A12
PETE “MAVERICK” MITCHELL opens his eyes from a deep sleep. He  
sits up, takes a deep breath, taking in the humble trailer he 
calls home. For those of us who know Maverick from long ago, 
we’re left to wonder how he ended up here.
He stands, moves to the kitchenette to start the coffee 
machine and, along with, his day.
INT. HANGAR HOME - DUSK 12 12
CLOSE ON the door of Mav’s trailer as he exits, holding a 
plate with his breakfast and a cup of joe. Pull back with him 
TO REVEAL:
The Airstream occupies a space one could only describe as the 
ultimate bachelor pad - motorcycles, a vintage car, a 
workbench covered with memories of a life dedicated to flight 
and, the centerpiece: A World War Two-era P-51 MUSTANG.
If we suspected for a moment that Maverick had ended up on 
his ass, we were sorely mistaken.
TIME CUT: As Maverick eats his breakfast at a small table 
across from an empty chair.
(CONTINUED)
Maverick finishes his breakfast, stands, pats the P-51 with 
affection as he passes her on his way to the workbench. 
REVEAL: CLOSE SHOTS of Mav’s surroundings (as he dresses in 
b.g.): TROPHIES and AIRSPEED RECORDS, PHOTOS of a younger 
Maverick, with ICEMAN, at Ice’s wedding, with GOOSE, CAROLE 
and their young son BRADLEY. Mav with that same boy as a 
TEEN.
He opens a cabinet lined with jackets. He pulls one out, 
wrapped in plastic, saved for special occasions, it seems. He 
rips the plastic off revealing patch laden leather that’s 
been around a long, long time.
Mav passes a calendar, the date marked in red:
MACH 9 TODAY
He walks past a COLLECTION OF MOTORCYCLES, a beaten up old 
Pepsi machine, stops at one bike under a tarp. Revealing a 
familiar ‘86 KAWASAKI NINJA.
CLOSE ON: Aviators and a set of keys by a helmet. 
He takes the keys and sunglasses, leaves the helmet...
EXT. HANGAR - DESERT ROAD 13 13
VROOOM. Maverick screams away from the hangar, spiraling 
dust, taking his machine to the limit.
EXT. CHINA LAKE TEST FACILITY - CALIFORNIA - DUSK 14 14
A maximum security military facility. At a gatehouse 
checkpoint, two ARMED UNIFORMS see him coming, open the gate, 
wave him through without stopping. They watch him go.
INT. TEST HANGAR - DUSK 15 15
A prototype high-hypersonic jet, THE DARKSTAR, dominates the 
hangar. It is unlike any machine we’ve ever seen before - 
itching to scream across the heavens. All it needs is a 
pilot. Mav strides in, ready to ride it. He stops, sees:
Several ENGINEERS (JACK, SIMON & MATTHEW) and TECHS, 
strangely motionless. Something is amiss. All sense of 
momentum stops. An amiable, salty Warrant Officer, BERNIE 
“HONDO” COLEMAN (35), grimaces.

Hondo looks to SIMON, the meek engineer who balks.
HONDO
Well go on.
JACK (JADED)

His girlfriend works at the

They say we fell short. The 
contract threshold is Mach Ten.
MAVERICK
Mach ten. That’s Mach ten two 
months from now. Today’s test point 
is Mach Nine.
HONDO
Well, that’s not good enough for 
someone at the Pentagon.

MAVERICK
Well he’s not gonna get it. Not

SIMON (MEEK)
Mav, Cain’s coming down now. He’s 
on his way to shut us down 
personally.
MAVERICK
He’s not here yet.

They want Mach ten, let’s give it 
to them. Get her ready to run up at 
eighteen-thirty.
SIMON (MEEK)
The test wasn’t ‘til nineteen 
hundred.
MAVERICK
Well, that was before the weather 
changed.
The team looks out at the perfectly calm, clear sky.
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
Gotta get out early if we want to 
beat this storm.

INT. SUIT-UP ROOM - TEST FACILITY - DUSK 16 16
State of the art. Maverick runs a treadmill. He wears a HIGH-
TECH OXYGEN MASK and heart monitor. Deep, steady breathing. 
HONDO
Don’t do this, Mav.
(Mav keeps running)
Mav, for God’s sake, you don’t need 
to do this. She hasn’t passed mach 
eight point five. She’s months away 
from ten. There’s no way this ends 
well.
But he doesn’t. He just keeps running.
TIME CUT: Mav finishes dressing in a pressure suit. A17 A17
HONDO (CONT’D)
Hey, you know, Mike called. He’s 
out in Reno with all those 
billionaires racing their P-51s. 
He’s making money hand over fist 
fixing warbirds, test flying ‘em, 
too.  He needs guys who know their 
stuff. We’d be rolling in it.
But Maverick isn’t listening. 
INT. LONG CORRIDOR - DAY AA17 AA17
DOZENS OF DARKSTAR TEAM MEMBERS - a mix of MEN and WOMEN - 
CIVILIANS and MILITARY alike, mill about in a long corridor, 
talking quietly, waiting.
A door opens OS and everyone falls silent. All eyes focus on:
MAVERICK, clad in his space suit, carrying his oxygen. We 
follow him from behind, watching as the team parts to let him 
pass. Hondo falls in step with him.
We move with them in profile.CONTINUED: (3) 15 15

WITH A TECH carrying his O2 unit, Mav does a walk-around 
inspection of the prototype jet. The engineers look on. 
INT. DARKSTAR COCKPIT - NIGHT 18 18
Maverick STRAPS IN the pilot’s chair. TECHS attach cables and 
hoses, secure Mav to his seat, give his harness a big yank. 
He fist bumps both of them before they step down. Hondo 
remains.

The canopy LOWERS, drowning him out. Mav gives a thumbs-up. 19 19

Maverick takes a deep breath, a moment of apprehension as it 
sinks in what he’s about to do.

catches their attention, growing louder, shaking the 
foundations of the guardhouse. 
REAR ADMIRAL CHESTER “HAMMER” CAIN, a cold-eyed 2-Star 
Admiral emerges from the back of his sedan as:

worth it.
He moves on. They part for him, offering muted thanks, some 
words of encouragement. Some can’t even look him in the eye.
It is a solemn moment of farewell. The passing of a legend.
As he passes the last of them, he stops and looks back.

sleep, eat, take a piss... Pilots 
that can disobey. All you did was 
buy time for those men out there.
(turns to Maverick)
The future is coming. And you’re 
not in it.
Without taking his eyes off Maverick:
CAIN (CONT’D)
Escort this man off the base... 
take to him to his quarters... wait 
with him while he packs his gear... 
(turns away)
I want him on the road to North 
Island within the hour. 
Beat.
MAVERICK
North Island... sir?
CAIN
Call came in with impeccable 
timing. Right when I was driving 
here to ground your ass once and 
for all. It galls me to say it, but 
for reasons known only to the 
almighty and your guardian angel... 
you’ve been called back to Top Gun.
Cain turns, sits back at the desk. Even Maverick is confused.
MAVERICK
Sir-
CAIN
You are dismissed, Captain.CONTINUED: 47 47

Maverick stands, hesitates, can’t help himself:
MAVERICK
On behalf of the team...
He plants the DARKSTAR’S STICK on the desk.
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
Mach 10 capable, sir. As promised.
Cain never looks up. Maverick turns to leave, stopping on:
CAIN
The end is inevitable, Maverick. 
Your kind is headed for extinction.
MAVERICK
Yes, sir... But not today. 
ALT: Maybe so, but not today, Sir.
And with a sly grin, Maverick is gone.

there is story here - Glory and ghosts. We pass a photo of 
ICEMAN AND MAVERICK, settle on a prominent photo of:
A stern-jawed ADMIRAL TOM KAZANSKY aka ICEMAN. “Commander of 
the Pacific Fleet”.
REVEAL: Maverick, staring at the past.
ADMIRAL’S AIDE (O.S.)

Mitchell.
Maverick snaps from his thoughts.
INT. OFFICERS’ BOARDROOM - DUSK 53 53
A MONITOR with an image that means little to us now but will 
come to dominate our thoughts. A HANDSOME, SQUARE-JAWED MAN 
(40s) steps in front of it. This is:
CYCLONE
At ease. Captain Pete “Maverick” 
Mitchell. Your reputation precedes 
you.
MAVERICK
Thank you, sir.
CYCLONE
It wasn’t a compliment. Admiral 
Beau Simpson. I’m the Airboss. I 
believe you know Admiral Bates.
CLOSE ON: ADMIRAL BATES (55). An affable, brilliant two-star, 
otherwise known as: 
MAVERICK
Warlock, Sir. I must admit, I 
wasn’t expecting an invitation 
back.
WARLOCK
They’re called orders, Maverick.
His tone is friendly enough, but the meaning is clear. No one 
is exactly excited to see Maverick back.
(CONTINUED)CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 23.
WARLOCK (CONT’D)
You two have something in common. 
Cyclone here was first in his class 
back in ‘88.
MAVERICK
Actually, sir, I finished second. 
Just want to manage expectations.
Awkward silence. Cyclone nods to Warlock who takes a remote 
and summons images on the monitors on the walls. Warlock 
clicks through SURVEILLANCE IMAGES of INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS at 
the base of a forbidding valley.
WARLOCK
The target is an unsanctioned 
uranium enrichment plant, 
constructed in violation of a 
unilateral NATO treaty. The uranium 
produced there represents a direct 
threat to our allies in the region. 
The Pentagon has tasked us with 
assembling a strike team and taking 
it out before it becomes fully 
operational.
Maverick steps closer, studying the screens as Warlock points 
to corresponding satellite and archival images, along with a 
profile of the run:
WARLOCK (CONT’D)
The plant sits in a recess at the 
end of this valley. Said valley is 
GPS jammed and defended by an 
extensive radar array, serving a 
limited number of fifth generation 
fighters which, in turn, are backed 
up by a plentiful reserve of 
surplus aircraft; F-16s and even a 
few old F-14s.
CYCLONE
Seems we’re not the only ones 
holding on to old relics.
Maverick lets that go. He has to.
WARLOCK
What’s your read, Captain?
MAVERICK
Normally, this would be a cake-walk 
for the F-35’s stealth. But the GPS 
jamming negates that. CONTINUED: 53 53
(CONTINUED)CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 24.
The surface-to-air threat 
necessitates a low level, laser-
guided strike, tailor made for the 
F-18. I figure two precision bombs 
minimum. Makes it four planes, 
flying in pairs.
(studies topography)
That’s one helluva steep climb out, 
exposing you to all the surface-to-
air missiles. Survive that, it’s a 
dogfight all the way home.
WARLOCK
All requirements for which you have 
real-world experience.
MAVERICK
Not in the same mission, sir.
Beat. Maverick realizes.
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
Somebody’s not coming back from 
this.
CYCLONE
Can it be done or not?
MAVERICK
How soon until the plant becomes 
operational?
WARLOCK
Three weeks. Maybe less.
Maverick realizes...
MAVERICK
Well, it’s a been a while since 
I’ve flown an F-18... And I’m not 
sure who I’d trust to fly the other 
three.

WARLOCK
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

want you to teach it. CONTINUED: (2) 53 53

MAVERICK

Warlock hits a button and TWELVE PILOT I.D. PHOTOS appear:
CYCLONE
We’ve recalled twelve Top Gun 
graduates from their squadrons, all 
top of their class. You will narrow 
this pool down to six - the best of 
the best. They will fly the 
mission.
Maverick’s eyes lock on one face in particular. The stoic 
face of BRADLEY “ROOSTER” BRADSHAW. 
CYCLONE (CONT’D)
Is there a problem, Captain?
MAVERICK
You know there is... sir.
CYCLONE

Bradley Bradshaw. AKA Rooster. I 
understand you flew with his old 
man... What was his call sign?
MAVERICK
Goose. Sir.
CYCLONE
Tragic what happened.
Warlock is uncomfortable with this:
WARLOCK
Captain Mitchell was cleared of any 
wrongdoing. Goose’s death was an 
accident. 
CYCLONE
That how you see it, Captain?
(points to Bradshaw)
Is that how Goose’s son sees it?
Maverick has had about enough of this shit, but soldiers on.

a teacher.CONTINUED: (3) 53 53

CYCLONE
You were a Top Gun instructor 
before.
MAVERICK
Sir, that was thirty years ago. I 
lasted two months. This is not 
where I belong.
CYCLONE
Let me be perfectly blunt. You 
weren’t our first choice. You 
weren’t even on the list. But 
someone put your name in the 
SECDEF’s ear. We all know who.
WARLOCK
Captain Mitchell has real-world 
experience akin to every segment of 
this operation.
CYCLONE
What Captain Mitchell has is a 
friend in the Pacific Fleet.
(to Maverick)
You’re here at the request of 
Admiral Kazansky. Iceman is a man I 
deeply admire. He seems to think 
you still have something to offer 
the Navy. What that is, I can’t 
imagine. You don’t have to take the 
job, but I should make it clear: 
This is your last post, Captain. 
You fly for Top Gun or you don’t 
fly for the Navy. Ever again.
Maverick looks at the picture of Rooster one more time.

Hangman hits three bulls-eyes in a row, smiles, doesn’t crow, 
takes money from Coyote before making brief eye contact with 
Maverick - no idea who he’s looking at.
CLOSE ON: Mav’s phone buzzes on the bar. The icon photo is 
that of ICEMAN, in Admiral’s uniform. 
           ICE: That went well.
Mav grudgingly responds.
           M:   The kid’s not ready for this mission.
           ICE: No one is. That’s why you’re here.
           M:   You could have warned me.
           ICE: Would you have come?
Maverick’s thumbs hover, unsure how to reply. Beat.
           ICE: Sorry I couldn’t be there.
           M:   Where were you?

“that’s right.” He raises a thick bound MANUAL:

ROOSTER
Don’t worry about it.
PHOENIX
I’m going on this mission. 
But if you get kicked out, you 
could leave us flying with Hangman. 
So what the hell was that-
ROOSTER
HE PULLED MY PAPERS.

You’re talking about the best

Captain.
MAVERICK
That’s what they’ve been told for 
their entire careers - while 
they’ve been dropping bombs from 
high altitude with little to no 
dogfighting. The parameters of this 
mission call for something they’ve 
never encountered-

canyon, the harder it will be to 
stay under the radar of these enemy

canyon, the less margin for error 
there will be. The tighter the 
turns, the more intensely the force 
of gravity on your body multiplies.

me the last time. You’re the only

Either way, I could lose him... 
forever.
Ice waits. Mav looks at the screen.
      It’s time to let go.
And Maverick nods, reaching the core of it, of himself:
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
I know... I know...
Ice stands, but his hands on his friend’s shoulders, 
struggles to speak:
ICEMAN
The Navy needs Maverick. That kid 
needs Maverick. They just don’t 
want to admit it. That’s why I 
fought for you. That’s why you’re 
still here.
Maverick is deeply touched. Then realizes:
MAVERICK
You knew Rooster was on this 
assignment before you chose me, 
didn’t you?
Busted, Ice smiles. The two friends embrace.
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
You’re a warrior, Ice. A fighter.
CLOSE ON Ice’s face. He knows otherwise.

CLOSE ON: A football. Hands come down into frame, grip it, 
ready to snap it right to left.
REVEAL: The pilots are divided into two teams, squaring off 
in a game of football with one unusual feature:
There are two balls. Both quarterbacks snap at the same time. 
Both teams scramble. In an instant, it is chaos.
Maverick is a quarterback on one team, Rooster on the other. 
Rooster manages to make a pass. Maverick is sacked. In fact, 
the opposition seems to care more about sacking the teacher 
than they do about scoring.
Yet, in the midst of the hard-hits, we see something we 
haven’t seen before: camaraderie.
Hondo makes an epic attempt at a touchdown despite half the 
class clinging to him. Hangman looks down at a prone 
Maverick, relishing a kill. Rooster, walks past, stops, 
grudgingly helps him up. It is the first remotely friendly 
moment they have shared.
Maverick, a little sore, tenderly heads off field, waving Bob 
in as his replacement. 
EXT. HARD DECK BAR - REAR 150 150
Maverick sits in one of two low lawn chairs, watching the 
chaos, mildly amused. He helps himself to a beer from a 
cooler as he eyes:
Hangman helping Rooster off the ground. Another truce of 
sorts.
Both balls snap and the entire class clashes. Anarchy. Mav 
smiles.

Maverick looks up at:

Cyclone is standing just beside Maverick, sunglasses hiding 
his eyes. He stares at the game, perplexed.

MAVERICK
Dog fight football. Offense and

Admiral.
Maverick and Cyclone turns their heads to see Warlock and 
Hondo approaching.

At the request of Hondo here, I’ve 
just been down to inspect Captain 
Mitchell’s plane.
Cyclone looks to Hondo: “Well?”

He stares at his phone and a photo of his young self with 
Maverick. After a hesitant beat, he deletes it. 
Maverick enters, notices a photo in Rooster’s locker:
GOOSE, his wife CAROL, and a tow-headed 3-year-old Rooster, 
arms around each other, happy. It watches over the scene:
MAVERICK
They’ll keep Phoenix and Bob in the 
hospital overnight for observation. 
But they’re going to be okay.
ROOSTER
I have never lost a wingman. In 
combat, off a carrier, never.
MAVERICK
You’ve been lucky. Fly long enough, 
it’ll happen. There will be others.
ROOSTER
Easy for you to say. No kids, no 
family. No one to mourn you when 
you burn in.
MAVERICK
Go home. Get some sleep.
He turns to leave, stopping on:
ROOSTER
WHY DID YOU PULL MY PAPERS AT THE 
ACADEMY? WHY DID YOU STAND IN MY 
WAY? 
The words sting them both. Maverick wants to tell the truth, 
but can’t. After a long pause.
MAVERICK

you?

Rooster smiles at the irony.
ROOSTER

gonna make the same mistake.
Before Maverick can respond:

Maverick turns, seeing something in Warlock’s eyes. And in 
that moment he knows. The sound of taps takes us to:

A portrait of Iceman presides over his funeral. An AMERICAN 
FLAG is presented to his wife. Her sons, their wives and 
small children are all by her side.
A large group of NAVAL OFFICERS and their FAMILIES are in 
attendance. Officers are all in crisp dress blues.
Maverick stands beside Iceman’s family. Elsewhere, Penny’s 
with Amelia. Cyclone receives the folded flag from the 
officers and presents it to Sarah. 
Sarah glances to Maverick who begins his eulogy. 
MAVERICK
Ice understood what it is to be a 
wingman. A wingman is willing to 
defend your life with their 
own...stay with you no matter how 
impossible the odds... More than 
anything, a wingman is there to 
push you beyond your limits, 
encourage you to find the very best 
in yourself. Ice was a wingman to 
his family, his friends, to every 
life he touched. That is why I know 
he’ll never be truly gone.

On the one hand, you’ve 
demonstrated that the mission can 
be flown. Perhaps in the only way

Once your F-18 strike team crosses 
the border, Tomahawk Missiles from

in a synchronized strike on the 
enemy’s airfield... here.

The moment those Tomahawks hit, the 
enemy will know you’re coming. Your 
time to target will be two minutes

that and you will be exposed to any 
aircraft the Tomahawks may have 
missed.

With nowhere else to go, he goes:CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 166.
INT./EXT. MAVERICK’S HANGAR - DAY - DAYS LATER 327 327
Where Maverick holds a photo of the moment on the Roosevelt 
with Rooster and the others, adding it to his wall of 
memories, medals, accomplishments - a life well-lived, if 
somewhat incomplete.
Among the pictures is one of Goose and Maverick in the bloom 
of their youth - their whole lives ahead of them.
Maverick steps back, takes in the space - the P-51, the 
airstream, the bikes...
The sound of a car OS. He turns in time to see it coming to a 
stop. The door opens and out climbs Rooster. From the 
passenger door emerges Phoenix.
Emerging from the back is Amelia and, finally Penny.
She takes in the sight of the hangar - along with everyone 
else - clearly a place they have never seen before.
CLOSE ON: Mav and Penny as they meet by the P-51.
PENNY
I heard you were looking for me.
Maverick nods. A confession.
MAVERICK
Good trip?
PENNY
Great. You?
MAVERICK
I could tell you, but...
PENNY
Forget I asked.
They both smile. After a beat.
MAVERICK
I missed you.
PENNY
I know. 
They kiss.

MAVERICK
(re hangar)
Whatta’ya think?
PENNY
It’s... very you.
(ALT)
It’s just like I pictured.
(ALT)
I’m still taking it in.
(ALT)
You know..? It works.
END ALTS
TIME CUT as Phoenix holds two model planes, demonstrating air-
to-air combat to a very interested Amelia. 
As Maverick walks Penny around the other lady in his life - 
the P-51.
As Rooster looks over Maverick’s workspace, the pictures of 
Maverick and Ice, of Maverick and Goose, of Rooster as a 
boy... Topped off by Maverick and Rooster on the carrier.
Rooster turns, looks at the make-shift family taking shape in 
this makeshift home...
And he smiles.
As the sound of a roaring engine takes us to:
INT. P-51 - DAY 328 328
Penny snugly in the back seat, Maverick at the controls.
MAVERICK
How’re you doing back there?
PENNY
I’m amazed something this old can 
still fly.
MAVERICK
C’mon, don’t say old. It’s vintage. 
One more time, if anything goes 
wrong and it probably won’t. But if 
it does, I’ll just open the canopy-
PENNY
Uh huh.CONTINUED: 327 327

MAVERICK
When that’s gone, you just undo 
your seatbelt- 
PENNY
Right...
MAVERICK
I’ll roll her over and dump you 
out.
PENNY
You know this isn’t working on me.
MAVERICK
Just remember to pull that handle 
on your parachute.
PENNY
Pete-
MAVERICK
Penny-
PENNY
Will you ever grow up?
MAVERICK
Some day...
And that glimmer comes to his eye.
MAVERICK (CONT’D)
But not today.
And he yanks the stick hard.
EXT. P-51 329 329
And the plane banks away from us with Penny screaming, 
laughing. 
But mostly screaming.
MAVERICK
JIBE-HO.
