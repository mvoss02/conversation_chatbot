I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a nail gun, and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I killed another girl with a chainsaw - I had to, she almost got away. There was someone else there, maybe a model, I can't remember but she's dead too. And Paul Owen. I killed Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen. I don't want to leave anything out here... I guess I've killed 20 people, maybe 40 - I have tapes of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even... well I ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I just, well I had to kill a lot of people and I'm not sure I'm going to get away with it this time - I mean I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.
