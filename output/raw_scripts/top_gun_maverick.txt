<HONDO> Well go on. 
<HONDO> They say we fell short. The contract threshold is Mach Ten. 
<MAIN> Mach ten. That’s Mach ten two months from now. Today’s test point is Mach Nine. 
<HONDO> Well, that’s not good enough for someone at the Pentagon. 
<MAIN> Who? 
<HONDO> Spit it out Simon. 
<HONDO> Of course. The Drone Ranger. He wants our budget for his unmanned program... 
<MAIN> Well he’s not gonna get it. Not today. 
<MAIN> He’s not here yet. 
<MAIN> Well, that was before the weather changed. 
<MAIN> Yeah, but dark blue. Ominous. JACK 
<MAIN> Only one I got. 
<HONDO> Now remember. Contact threshold is Mach ten. Not point-one, not point- two. Mach Ten. That should keep the program alive. 
<MAIN> Only one I got. 
<MAIN> Control, this is Darkstar. How do you read? 
<MAIN> Loud and clear. Ready for APU start. 
<HONDO> You know Mav, you don’t have to do this. 
<MAIN> I know what happens to the program if I don’t. 
<HONDO> Cleared APU start. Mav presses the APU START button and the left engine whines. 
<MAIN> Good start.

<MAIN> North Island... sir? 
<CAIN> Call came in with impeccable timing. Right when I was driving here to ground your ass once and for all. It galls me to say it, but for reasons known only to the almighty and your guardian angel... you’ve been called back to Top Gun. 
<MAIN> Sir- 
<CAIN> You are dismissed, Captain.CONTINUED: 47 47 CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL

<CYCLONE> It wasn’t a compliment. Admiral Beau Simpson. I’m the Airboss. I believe you know Admiral Bates. 
<WARLOCK> They’re called orders, Maverick. 
<MAIN> Actually, sir, I finished second. Just want to manage expectations. 
<WARLOCK> The target is an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, constructed in violation of a unilateral NATO treaty. The uranium produced there represents a direct threat to our allies in the region. The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling a strike team and taking it out before it becomes fully operational. 
<CYCLONE> Seems we’re not the only ones holding on to old relics. 
<WARLOCK> What’s your read, Captain? 
<MAIN> Normally, this would be a cake-walk for the F-35’s stealth. But the GPS jamming negates that. CONTINUED: 53 53 CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL

<CYCLONE> Can it be done or not? 
<MAIN> How soon until the plant becomes operational? 
<WARLOCK> Three weeks. Maybe less. 
<MAIN> Well, it’s a been a while since I’ve flown an F-18... And I’m not sure who I’d trust to fly the other three. 
<WARLOCK> I think you misunderstand, Captain.

<MAIN> I’m just as surprised as you are. 
<PENNY> I bought this place three years a go... You must be in a lotta trouble. No way you’d come back here willingly. 
<MAIN> No, this is... I think this is it. 
<PENNY> Come on. You’ve been saying that for thirty years. You said it after my father chased you out my bedroom window. You said it again when they busted you for that high speed pass. Next thing I know you’re off to Bosnia. Then Iraq. Both times. I don’t even remember the charges before they shipped you off to the desert, test-flying God knows what.

<BOB> We’re losing the right engine. 
<PHOENIX> It’s still spinning. I’m gonna try to restart it. Phoenix flips the APU switch and pushes the right throttle forward. 
<PHOENIX> Goddamnit. 
<MAIN> Oh my God. 
<PHOENIX> We lost hydraulics. I can’t control it. 
<PHOENIX> No, sir. 
<CYCLONE> Would you say that his training left you no margin for error? 
<PHOENIX> We suffered a double engine failure at low altitude. We had no choice but to eject. 
<CYCLONE> Would you say that his training left you no margin for error? 
<BOB> I know what you want me to say. I’m not going to say it. 
<PHOENIX> We did what the mission calls for. Captain Mitchell is not responsible for what happened out there. 
<CYCLONE> Come again? 
<HONDO> There’s bird guts all down the starboard side of Mav- Of Captain Mitchell’s plane, sir. Phoenix was flying in tight formation with him. I’m guessing the wreckage’ll show she took a flock of birds head on. Cyclone looks at Maverick for another beat, then walks away. Warlock follows, leaving Maverick and Hondo to share a look.CONTINUED: 207 207CHERRY 11.25.19 - OFFICIAL 
<ROOSTER> I have never lost a wingman. In combat, off a carrier, never. 
<MAIN> You’ve been lucky. Fly long enough, it’ll happen. There will be others.

<MAIN> Go home. Get some sleep. 
<MAIN> ...You weren’t ready. 
<ROOSTER> Ready for what? Ready to fly like you? 
<ROOSTER> My dad believed in you. I’m not gonna make the same mistake. 
<CYCLONE> I can only imagine what you must be feeling. Take some time. Whatever you need. 
<MAIN> I appreciate that, sir. But there’s no time. The mission is in- 
<CYCLONE> I’ll be taking over the training from here. 
<MAIN> Sir... 
<CYCLONE> We both know you didn’t want this job, Captain.

<BOB> Sir, won’t we be giving their planes time to intercept? 
<CYCLONE> Well, Lieutenant you have a fighting chance against enemy aircraft. What are the odds of survival in a head-on collision with a mountain? 
<CYCLONE> Who the hell is that?

<HANGMAN> 10 Gs... Damn. 
<CYCLONE> On the one hand, you’ve demonstrated that the mission can be flown. Perhaps in the only way it can be survived. On the other hand, you did so by stealing a multi-million dollar military aircraft and flying it in such a manner that it may never be airworthy again. 
<WARLOCK> I believe the Admiral is asking a rhetorical question, Captain. 
<MAIN> Sir. 
<WARLOCK> It’s an underground bunker tucked between these two mountains. Your route of ingress is heavily defended by surface to air missiles, backed up by fifth generation fighters. 
<MAIN> Most importantly, remember coffin corner. On the climb out of the valley, you’ll be exposed to enemy missiles. Remember, get low as fast as you can and break for home. 
<MAIN> Payback and Fanboy... Phoenix and Bob. 
<WARLOCK> And your wingman? 
<MAIN> Rooster.
