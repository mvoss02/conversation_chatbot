<MOTHER> Do you want to play a game? 
<MOTHER> What do you think Papa does? 
<MOTHER> Is that who you love? Murderers? 
<MOTHER> Leave me be. Go play. 
<MAIN> You okay? 
<MADELEINE> Yes. Let’s go. 
<MAIN> How’s the view? 
<MADELEINE> It’s growing on me. 
<MAIN> We don’t need to go faster. We have all the time in the world. 
<MAIN> Buona sera. 
<MADELEINE> You can’t help looking over your shoulder. 
<MAIN> What? 
<MADELEINE> No one’s coming. 
<MAIN> I wasn’t looking over my shoulder. 
<MADELEINE> Yes you were. 
<MAIN> Are we going to have a row about this? 
<PORTER> Secrets, wishes, letting go of the past. Getting rid of the old, in comes the new. 
<MADELEINE> Je t’aime . 
<MAIN> Where did you go to? Today. By the water. Tell me. 
<MADELEINE> I’ll tell you if you tell me about Vesper. 
<MAIN> Is that why we’re here? 
<MADELEINE> She’s buried at the acropolis - 
<MAIN> I know where she’s buried. 
<MADELEINE> Can you forgive her? For us? 
<MAIN> I left her behind a long time ago. 
<MADELEINE> As long as we’re looking over our shoulder, the past is not dead. 
<MADELEINE> You have to let her go even if it’s hard. 
<MAIN> You mean, if we’re to have a future? 
<MAIN> So I do this and then..? 
<MADELEINE> I’ll tell you all my secrets. 
<MAIN> Okay. 
<MAIN> I’m going to go and do this and I’m going to come back for breakfast. 
<MADELEINE> Thank you. 
<MAIN> And then you’re going to tell me where we’re going next. 
<MAIN> Buongiorno. La tombe del Lynd . 
<BOY> Come. 
<MAIN> I miss you. 
<PRIMO> Blofeld sends his regards. 
<PRIMO> She’s a daughter of Spectre. She’s a daughter... of Spectre. 
<PORTER> Your baggage is already down Mr Bond. As your wife requested. 
<MAIN> Letting go is hard. 
<MADELEINE> James! What happened? 
<MADELEINE> What happened? 
<MADELEINE> What are you talking about? 
<MAIN> Madeleine, how did they know I was here? 
<MADELEINE> I have no idea... 
<MAIN> Spectre. How did they know? 
<MADELEINE> What are you talking... I didn’t do anything. She looks panicked. The phone rings. Bond grabs Madeleine’s handbag. 
<MAIN> We’re leaving. 
<MADELEINE> There is something I need to tell you. 
<MAIN> I bet there is! 
<MAIN> Pick it up. 
<VOICE> It’s Blofeld my love. Your father would be so proud of you. Your sacrifice will be our glory. 
<MADELEINE> I don’t understand... 
<KID> Hello. 
<KID> Why? 
<MADELEINE> James. Why? Why would I betray you? 
<MADELEINE> James. James, listen to me. I would rather die than have you think... 
<MADELEINE> James! Do something. James! 
<MADELEINE> Say something James! 
<MAIN> Okay. 
<MADELEINE> So, this is it? 
<MAIN> This is it. 
<MADELEINE> How will I know that you are ok? 
<MAIN> You won’t. You’ll never see me again. 
<VALDO> This was good soup. Now it is waste. Even if it is joke. Idiotic. 
<VALDO> One day I will put Ebola in your tea and then I will watch as your faces sweat blood and I will be laughing. 
<VALDO> Doctor Obruchev. 
<VALDO> Who? 
<VALDO> Safin? 
<VALDO> They will not kill me. Transferring the files as we speak. Now...now it’s done. What do I do with it? 
<VALDO> Swallow the..? 
<VALDO> Yes! I like animals! Bye-bye. 
<ANNOUNCEMENT> Danger. Illegal access detected. Secure all bio-hazardous materials immediately. 
<VALDO> Hello. 
<PRIMO> Open the Bio-Security Level 4 fridge. 
<VALDO> And...er? 
<PRIMO> Give me the weapon. 
<VALDO> What weapon? We have...er... 
<PRIMO> Heracles. 
<VALDO> It requires double authentication. 
<PRIMO> Which one? 
<VALDO> Him. 
<ANNOUNCEMENT> Warning. Facility lockdown in progress. All exits are now sealed. 
<VALDO> What is this? A safety belt, this? 
<VALDO> I cannot! That is not elevator! 
<MONEYPENNY> Sir, I’ve just received the most unusual... 
<M> I’ve seen it. 
<M> Jesus Christ! 
<MONEYPENNY> Sir, what’s the Heracles project? This lab isn’t on the books. 
<M> No it’s not. 
<MONEYPENNY> There were casualties. 
<M> It was a gas leak. 
<MONEYPENNY> Shall I alert the PM--? 
<M> It was a gas leak. I’ll handle it. 
<M> Moneypenny 
<MAIN> Well isn’t this a surprise Felix! 
<FELIX> James. 
<MAIN> Who’s the blonde? 
<ASH> Logan -- EXT. ALLEY WAY - DUSK 66 66 Bond walks them past SCHOOL KIDS playing video games on TVs on a long table - like an outdoor home arcade. 
<MAIN> You didn’t get the memo. I’m retired. 
<FELIX> I wouldn’t ask if you were still in Her Majesty’s service. 
<MAIN> And what does that mean? 
<FELIX> Our elected leaders aren’t playing nice in the sandbox. James, is there somewhere quiet where we can talk in private? 
<BONDS> Quiet? Yeah. 
<FELIX> I was hoping you could pick up a package. 
<FELIX> FOUR. 
<MAIN> Where’s the package? 
<MAIN> Oh, I love it there! 
<ASH> Valdo Obruchev. 
<FELIX> You’re going to say you’ve never heard of him... 
<MAIN> Never heard of him. 
<MAIN> Two. 
<FELIX> Three. 
<FELIX> Ah, it’s a good life! 
<ASH> You never heard of him? Didn’t he defect during your tenure at MI6? 
<FELIX> Obruchev was kidnapped three days ago from a secret MI6 lab in London. Two days ago his mug pinged on a facial recognition sweep in Santiago de Cuba. 
<ASH> He’s leaving out the best part. Spectre. 
<FELIX> C’mon it’ll be like old times. 
<MAIN> Three. 
<FELIX> Two. 
<ASH> You’re really the only guy for the job. You’re the guy. 
<MAIN> My round. 
<NOMI> Hi. 
<MAIN> Scotch. 
<BARTENDER> Yeah man. 
<FELIX> Political appointee, not my choice. Seems intelligence isn’t central anymore. 
<MAIN> He smiles too much. 
<FELIX> Help us get this into the right hands. 
<MAIN> What, and you’re the right hands? 
<FELIX> I’m not just a pretty face. 
<MAIN> I stopped trusting pretty faces a long time ago, Felix. 
<FELIX> Yeah I heard. Bad luck. 
<MAIN> Bad judgment. 
<FELIX> Harder to tell the good from bad, villains from heroes these days. I need you James. You’re the only one I trust with this. I’m not screwing around. I wanna get back to my family, tell them I saved the world again. Don’t you? 
<MAIN> Nice to see you again Felix. 
<FELIX> At least take my number. 
<NOMI> In trouble? 
<MAIN> Constantly. 
<NOMI> Need a ride? 
<MAIN> Sure. Why not? 
<NOMI> Hol’ on. 
<MAIN> What’s your name? 
<MAIN> James. Call me James. What do you do, Nomi? 
<NOMI> I’m a diver. 
<MAIN> What do you dive for? 
<NOMI> I have a thing for old wrecks. 
<MAIN> Well then you’ve come to the right place. 
<MAIN> After you. 
<NOMI> Nice house. 
<MAIN> Thank you. 
<NOMI> Is that the bedroom? 
<MAIN> Yes it is. 
<MAIN> Well, that’s not the first thing I thought you’d take off, but - She sits on the bed. Smiles. But frank now. Not flirty- 
<NOMI> Yeah, you seem like a man who’s gagging for some action, Mister Bond. 
<MAIN> Shall we cut to the chase? 
<NOMI> I’m here as a professional courtesy. 
<MAIN> Well you’re not very courteous are you? You’ve broken my car. It’s Commander Bond, you know that. 
<NOMI> Two years. 
<MAIN> Very young. 
<NOMI> High achiever. 
<MAIN> Jesus Christ. 
<NOMI> The world’s moved on since you retired, Commander Bond, perhaps you didn’t notice. 
<MAIN> No can’t say I had. And in my humble opinion, the world doesn’t change very much. 
<MAIN> You need to ask yourself a few more questions. MI6... CIA. Chasing after the same man and not communicating with each other? That’s not good. You know what, tell M hello. But I don’t work for him anymore. 
<NOMI> Tell him yourself. 
<NOMI> By the way I’m not just any old double-O, I’m 007. 
<NOMI> You probably thought they’d retire it. 
<M> How’s it going Q? 
<Q> Several large files seemed to have been wiped from Obruchev’s hard drive. He was working on some pretty advanced - 
<M> Can you retrieve the files? 
<Q> Trying. 
<M> Get me everything you can, then destroy the drive. 
<Q> If I knew more about what this was I could - 
<M> Thank you Q. That’s all. 
<TANNER> The PM is calling again. 
<M> 007. Tell them something, anything. 
<M> 007. 
<M> Bond. 
<MAIN> I met your new 007. She’s a disarming young woman. So, Obruchev - you kept him on the payroll didn’t you? 
<M> Stay out of it. This has nothing to do with you. 
<MAIN> It does. It’s Spectre. 
<TANNER> Double-O trouble? 
<M> The CIA have the advantage. Get me Blofeld. 
<TANNER> Sir? He only speaks to his psychiatrist. 
<M> I know. The live feed is what I want. 
<TANNER> He’s like this everyday. Mad as a bag of bees. 
<M> Good. 
<Q> What is it? 
<M> It’s nothing. 
<MAIN> Felix, I’m in. 
<PALOMA> You’re late. Vamos. 
<MAIN> Something about a hat -- Paris -- 
<PALOMA> -- What hat? Oh. El codigo. Si Si. I forget things when I get nervous. This is the biggest job I’ve ever had. 
<MAIN> This your room? 
<PALOMA> It’s a wine cellar. Okay, come here. 
<MAIN> Don’t you think we ought to get to know each other just a little before we... 
<MAIN> Alright. 
<PALOMA> You do it. 
<MAIN> Do you mind... 
<MAIN> This is going to go brilliantly. 
<PALOMA> I know. 
<PALOMA> Okay? 
<MAIN> Let’s get a drink. 
<PALOMA> Good idea. 
<MAIN> Two vodka martinis, shaken, not stirred. 
<PALOMA> So I can hear you. 
<MAIN> What shall we drink to? 
<PALOMA> Felix? 
<MAIN> To Felix. 
<PALOMA> Vamos? 
<MAIN> Sure. 
<PRIMO> Will this sample be enough for you? 
<VALDO> If he has used it, yes. It is now progressing. 
<VALDO> Oops! Sorry. Terrible, terrible gloves, so slippery. 
<VALDO> Forgive me. 
<PRIMO> How much longer? 
<VALDO> Ah! To happy new future for Spectre. 
<VALDO> Now it is ready. 
<MAIN> You go that way, I’ll go this way. 
<MAIN> Yes and it looks like all of them. 
<MAIN> Cyclops. We ran into each other in Italy. That was an eye-opening experience. 
<PALOMA> Scanning. 
<PALOMA> Found it. 
<PALOMA> Who’s the birthday boy? 
<MAIN> Ernst Stavro Blofeld. 
<PALOMA> He’s here? 
<MAIN> No. He’s in London. In prison. 
<MAIN> Because I put him there. 
<PALOMA> I’ve spotted him. Our little Russian scientist. 
<MAIN> Have you got him? 
<PALOMA> I got him. 
<PALOMA> Coño! You’re popular tonight. 
<VALDO> No? Oh. 
<MAIN> Go! 
<MAIN> Thank you. I’ll take this. 
<PALOMA> What was that? 
<MAIN> Time to go. Let’s go! 
<PALOMA> Clear! 
<NOMI> May I cut in? 
<PALOMA> Go get him. I’ll hold them off. 
<MAIN> I’ll be right there. 
<MAIN> Three weeks training, really? 
<PALOMA> More or less. 
<MAIN> Still gonna need that car. Salut! 
<PALOMA> Salut! 
<NOMI> I’m taking you back to Mother, darling. 
<VALDO> Mother? Oh no, no, no, no. 
<MAIN> Stay there! 
<PALOMA> I’m great! 
<MAIN> I’m gonna borrow your plane, sorry. 
<PALOMA> It’s a short cut. 
<PALOMA> This is my stop. Goodbye. 
<MAIN> You were excellent. 
<MAIN> I will. 
<PALOMA> Hey! Cigar for Felix. 
<MAIN> Thank you. 
<PALOMA> Ciao. 
<MAIN> Ciao. 
<MAIN> Come on, let’s go. 
<VALDO> No, no, no sir, I’m not getting on that. 
<MAIN> Well that’s a shame because we don’t have a choice. Let’s go. Come on. 
<MAIN> Okay, okay. What have we got here? 
<VALDO> Sir, I just saved your life. Please remember that. So could you please tell me what the hell is going on Where are you taking me? 
<MAIN> Somewhere safe. 
<FELIX> At least make it look hard. 
<MAIN> Thanks Felix. You walked me into a trap. 
<FELIX> What trap? 
<MAIN> Spectre is dead. 
<MAIN> All of them. 
<FELIX> Good. 
<MAIN> What is this? Explain it to me. 
<VALDO> I don’t have the words to describe to someone like you. 
<MAIN> Try one. 
<VALDO> It’s... Perfect. 
<MAIN> A perfect what? 
<VALDO> Assassin. 
<ASH> Thank you Bond, your mission is done. We can take it from here. 
<MAIN> Why didn’t it kill me? 
<ASH> You don’t have to answer those questions. Bond... 
<MAIN> Why Spectre? 
<ASH> Bond, please stop asking... 
<MAIN> QUIET! 
<VALDO> Because you were never the intended target. 
<FELIX> He was a target, why? 
<VALDO> I changed the DNA like we decided and now the plan is complete and... 
<MAIN> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who is we? 
<ASH> He is not allowed to do this. 
<MAIN> Did M make you build this? 
<ASH> He is out of line here Felix. 
<FELIX> Ash... 
<MAIN> Did M order you to kill Spectre. 
<ASH> Don’t answer that. 
<MAIN> Is M behind this? 
<ASH> HE IS OUT OF LINE. 
<MAIN> FELIX. 
<FELIX> ASH, SHUT YOUR MOUTH. 
<VALDO> M helped me build it, but please he does not have the vision... 
<VALDO> ...for how to use it. 
<MAIN> Who does? Blofeld? How did he know I was going to be there? 
<ASH> I’m with Safin, you understand? 
<VALDO> Yes. I am Doctor Obruchev. 
<ASH> I know who you are. 
<FELIX> I don’t know about you but I get a feeling in my gut Ash might not be on our side. 
<FELIX> I’m with you. 
<MAIN> That’s a lot of blood. 
<VALDO> So, where are we going? 
<ASH> Get in the plane Doctor. 
<FELIX> This might be my last mission. 
<MAIN> I think you’re just looking for an excuse not to help me. Paloma, she gave me a cigar for you and you are going to smoke it. 
<FELIX> Nice but maybe you should hold on to that for now. 
<MAIN> You just stay put. Keep the pressure on that. I’m gonna find us a way out. 
<FELIX> I’ll be over here. 
<ASH> I was such a big fan of his. 
<MAIN> Felix! 
<FELIX> This doesn’t look good. 
<MAIN> Come on Felix. We’ve been in worse than this. Let’s go! 
<FELIX> It’s like back when I was a kid on that shrimper... 
<FELIX> Am I? I thought I made that up. 
<FELIX> Just let me go. Let me go. 
<MAIN> No! 
<MAIN> Yeah. 
<FELIX> Make it worth it. 
<FELIX> James. It’s a good life isn’t it? 
<MAIN> The best. Felix. 
<GUARD> Name. 
<MAIN> Bond. James Bond. Guard looks at him confused. Who? 
<MONEYPENNY> How’s retirement? 
<MAIN> 
<NOMI> Hi. Where’s Obruchev? 
<MONEYPENNY> I thought you two would get along. 
<WOMAN> Report, 007. 
<NOMI> Thank you. 
<WOMAN> 007. 
<NOMI> That must bother you. 
<NOMI> Where is he? 
<MAIN> He left me for somebody else. 
<NOMI> So, you lost him? 
<MONEYPENNY> You can go in. 
<MAIN> Thank you.NOMI Thank you. 
<MONEYPENNY> Alone, I’m afraid. 
<MAIN> Does that bother you? 
<NOMI> I get why you shot him. 
<MONEYPENNY> Yes, well. Everyone tries at least once. 
<MAIN> Has your desk got bigger or have you got smaller? 
<M> I can’t pretend there weren’t some sorry faces when you left us, Bond. But you fell so far off the grid that we thought you must be dead. 
<M> Now learning that you were in fact alive and well, working for the CIA, well that really was a blow. 
<MAIN> Well, they just asked so nicely. 
<M> It’s a shame that you haven’t lost your touch. We wouldn’t be in this mess. 
<MAIN> This is your mess. 
<M> We’re looking into it. 
<MAIN> I can identify the man that took Obruchev. 
<M> And what do you want in return, Bond? 
<MAIN> Blofeld. 
<M> Impossible. He’s in Belmarsh. 
<MAIN> Yes, he ran a Spectre meeting in Cuba from Belmarsh. 
<M> How? How? 
<M> No-one has access. No-one. 
<MAIN> Why didn’t you shut it down? Why didn’t you shut Heracles down? 
<M> I answer to the interests of my country. Not you. 
<M> I certainly don’t answer to Felix Leiter. 
<MAIN> Perhaps because he’s dead? 
<M> I’m sorry. I had a lot of respect for Leiter. 
<M> Look, if you have information, I’d be happy to receive it. 
<MAIN> Get me into Belmarsh. 
<M> No. Blofeld’s the only member of Spectre still breathing, I can’t risk that. 
<MAIN> Oh but you will risk developing a DNA targeting weapon with a corrupt scientist for ten years. 
<MAIN> My God! You’re thirsty at the moment - M flips suddenly. Interrupting. It should be shocking. He’s not in a good place! Bond stays calm. 
<M> YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY. 
<M> Moneypenny, send 007 in please. You can go Bond. 
<MAIN> It’s definitely the same desk. 
<M> Go to Belmarsh. I want everything that Blofeld listens to, looks at and touches scanned. Scan every corner of that cell. Scan the whole prison, in fact scan the whole damn man. 
<NOMI> Sir. I’ll bring my gloves. INT. MI6 - ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER 122 122 Bond storms down the corridor to the elevators. 
<MONEYPENNY> What are you doing for dinner?M 
<Q> So you’re not dead! 
<MAIN> Hello Q. I’ve missed you. 
<MONEYPENNY> Mmmm. That smells great. 
<MAIN> Were you expecting somebody? 
<Q> Excuse me. This is the first time I’ve - he’ll be here in twenty minutes. I can’t take my focus off the - 
<MAIN> I need you to tell me what’s on that. 
<MAIN> You know they come with fur these days? 
<Q> I want to be very clear that I am not authorised to help you and I have sworn a - 
<MONEYPENNY> It’s to do with Heracles. 
<Q> I presume M doesn’t know that this is happening. 
<MONEYPENNY> No. But there’s something going on Q. We need to find out what it is. 
<Q> It’s never nine to five is it. 
<MAIN> Thank you. 
<Q> Er...Bond... 
<MAIN> Yes. 
<Q> Do you know where this has been? 
<MAIN> Everywhere I should imagine. 
<Q> Into the sandbox. 
<MONEYPENNY> Thank you. 
<Q> It’s a database. 
<MAIN> What’s the data? 
<Q> It’s DNA. Multiple individuals. What was M working on? 
<MAIN> Something he should have shut down years ago. 
<Q> Oh hello! 
<MAIN> What? 
<Q> There’s more. Hidden files. I was asked to recover what I could from Obruchev’s hard-drive just after the explosion. And I have a pretty good feeling that this... 
<Q> Is what was missing. 
<Q> So Obruchev is working for someone who managed to kill all of Spectre. 
<MAIN> Not all of them. 
<MONEYPENNY> Blofeld. 
<MAIN> Can you show me the other files? 
<Q> Wait. This can’t just be Spectre. Oh my God! There are thousands. 
<MAIN> Who are they? 
<Q> They’re in categories - I’m going to need more time to organi- 
<MONEYPENNY> There have been computer breaches round the world of databases holding DNA information. We’ve been tracking them. 
<MAIN> Ours? 
<MONEYPENNY> I can’t imagine they’re leaving us out. Whoever they are. 
<MONEYPENNY> Well, there’s only one person he’ll speak to. 
<MAIN> Who? M said no-one has access. 
<Q> Really? 
<MONEYPENNY> Did he? 
<MAIN> What’s that? 
<Q> Can I just have one nice evening please before the world explodes. 
<MAIN> Who has access? 
<MAIN> Who? 
<RECEPTIONIST> Morning. 
<MADELEINE> Morning. 
<MADELEINE> Thank you. 
<RECEPTIONIST> He’s weird. 
<MADELEINE> You can’t say that. 
<MADELEINE> I’m sorry I’m late. I wasn’t expecting a new - She looks at the new patient. Well dressed, with intelligent eyes and damaged facial skin. 
<MADELEINE> Patient. 
<SAFIN> Sorry if I surprised you. 
<MADELEINE> No, I like surprises. 
<SAFIN> You’re very attractive for a psychotherapist. Must be dangerous for your clients. 
<MADELEINE> They are usually more of a danger to themselves. 
<SAFIN> Foxgloves. Beautiful. Did you choose them? 
<MADELEINE> Yes, I find them friendly. 
<MADELEINE> Then I’ll make sure not to. 
<MADELEINE> Do you know a lot about flowers? 
<SAFIN> My father had a garden. He taught me. He died when I was young, but my interest... remained. 
<MADELEINE> It’s difficult to lose a parent. Especially at a young age. 
<SAFIN> Yes. Death has a particular effect on children, doesn’t it? 
<MADELEINE> What effect did it have on you? 
<SAFIN> Profound. 
<SAFIN> But I saved a life once. I think that had more of an effect. 
<SAFIN> Why is that? 
<SAFIN> Saving someone’s life connects you to them forever. The same as taking it -- they belong to you. 
<SAFIN> I’m not very good at talking about myself so I... I brought a memory box. I thought it might interest you. 
<SAFIN> I never forgot your eyes under the ice. They needed me. It is a shock to see them so many years later. They still need me. I am rather... taken by them. 
<MADELEINE> What do you want. 
<SAFIN> Just a favour. You owe me. 
<MADELEINE> You murdered my mother. 
<SAFIN> And your father killed my entire family. 
<SAFIN> I need you to visit someone for me. Wearing this. It’s harmless to you. You are the only one who can do it. 
<MADELEINE> No. Why would I do anything for you? 
<SAFIN> Because I am a man willing to kill the person you love most. 
<MADELEINE> I have already lost everyone I have ever loved. There is nothing you can threaten me with. 
<SAFIN> That is very sad to hear Madeleine... But it is not true, is it? 
<MAIN> Madeleine Swann? Really 
<M> Well yes, we took your information seriously, but that was five years ago. Nothing came up. 
<MAIN> She’s very smart and very good at hiding things. 
<M> She’s a useful asset. She’s the only psychiatrist he agreed to speak to. I had to exercise my judgment. 
<MAIN> Your judgement is the problem. 
<M> That weapon was designed to save lives and to eradicate collateral damage for our agents. A clean, accurate shot, every time. But it had to be off the books. There are enough holes in our national security. If the world knows what this can do - BOND They’d kill for it. 
<M> Look, if it’s an error, it’s on my shoulders. Fair and square. I’ve dedicated my life to defending this country. I believe in defending the principles of this... 
<MAIN> Blofeld. 
<MAIN> We managed to access a database of their targets. 
<M> “We?” Bond gives a little smile. M side-eyes him. He knows. 
<M> Oh for fuck’s sake! I see. And after Blofeld? What do they want? 
<MAIN> Well it’s hard to say. I would imagine world leaders, innocent civilians, freedom. You know, that sort of thing. 
<M> Oh good! Just the usual. 
<MAIN> Just the usual. 
<M> Blofeld was communicating with his agents in Cuba through a bionic eye which we have now retrieved. 
<MAIN> You’re welcome. 
<M> Spectre’s destruction is going to have huge consequences. M 
<MAIN> Sir. 
<TANNER> Bond. So the rumours are true. You look... well. 
<MAIN> Tanner! 
<TANNER> Sir, there’s been a development. 
<NOMI> It was disturbing to say the least. 
<Q> Wait till you see what it looks like up close. 
<MONEYPENNY> Ah...Bond’s In the office.M 
<Q> Oh, Bond! My God! I haven’t seen you in...in... How was your retirement? 
<M> Shut up Q. I know he’s staying with you. 
<NOMI> What happened? 
<TANNER> He’s been reinstated as a ‘00’. 
<NOMI> Double 0, what? 
<M> What have you got? 
<NOMI> Q has studied the blood samples I gathered from the victims of the funeral. Just look at this. 
<M> And what are we looking at? 
<TANNER> This is the funeral of one of the dead Spectre agents from Cuba. 
<M> Good work Nomi. 
<NOMI> Thank you sir. Double 0, what? 
<MONEYPENNY> What are they? 
<Q> They’re nanobots. 
<TANNER> Right. 
<Q> Microscopic bio-robots that can enter your system by the slightest contact with your skin. 
<M> Programmed with DNA to target specific individuals. Heracles was designed to be the most efficient weapon in our arsenal. Passing through people harmlessly before reaching its intended target. 
<Q> But Obruchev modified the nanobots so that they can kill anyone related to the target. 
<NOMI> Anyone? 
<Q> Well since it’s DNA based, with further modifications, yes. Families, certain genetic traits. Single nucleotide variants and polymorphisms that could target a range from individuals to... whole ethnicities. 
<MAIN> And the people become the weapon. 
<M> It was never intended to be a weapon of mass destruction. It was a... I need to call the Prime Minister. 
<TANNER> Yes sir. 
<M> And Q, hack into Blofeld’s bionic eye. See what you can find. 
<NOMI> We don’t have a trail. 
<MAIN> Logan Ash. State Department. Ex- State Department. Find him, you’ll find Obruchev. Good luck! 
<NOMI> Thanks! 
<NOMI> I’ll be outside when you’re done with your... important preparation. 
<MADELEINE> I’ll be just a moment. 
<TANNER> I know you and she have a history but we’ve kept a close eye on her over the years. She’s been very compliant. 
<MADELEINE> Ok. 
<TANNER> He is the most valuable asset this country has. I know you and he have a history but don’t let him get in your head. If you feel yourself losing control - 
<MAIN> Oh Tanner, relax. I’m not going to lose - Madeleine turns the corner. 
<MAIN> Control. 
<MAIN> Dr Swann. Good afternoon. 
<MADELEINE> Mr Bond. 
<MAIN> 007. 
<TANNER> This is where we leave you. Good luck. 
<NOMI> Just get us a name. 
<MADELEINE> We’re closer than ever. 
<NOMI> That was awkward. Does he have that effect on all women? 
<TANNER> Fifty-fifty. It’s unpredictable. 
<MAIN> You’re shaking. 
<MADELEINE> It’s not an ideal situation. 
<MADELEINE> Open the door. Open the door! 
<MADELEINE> DON’T. 
<MAIN> What is it? 
<MADELEINE> James. You don’t know what this is. Don’t make me do this. Please. 
<MAIN> Open the door. Open the door! 
<MAIN> Where are you going? 
<MADELEINE> Home. 
<TANNER> Wait. 
<NOMI> He won’t talk without her. 
<TANNER> Just wait. Special delivery. 
<BLOFELD> James! 
<MAIN> Hello Blofeld. Perhaps you can help me. Cuba was quite the party - happy birthday by the way. 
<BLOFELD> Thank you. 
<MAIN> I’m trying to piece together what happened. There you were - or here you were - with the world’s most powerful people, your friends, all in one room, a noose around my neck and your hands on the most valuable weapon in existence. It’s like a testimony to your greatness. A celebration of all that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld. 
<BLOFELD> Yes James. 
<BLOFELD> My sweet James. What do you want? 
<MAIN> Your enemies are closing in Blofeld. And the biggest twist here is that if you tell me who they are, I could save your life. 
<BLOFELD> My avenging angel. My chaser of lost causes. And now you even chase mine. But you’re asking the wrong question. Yes, Cuba was a disappointment but we all cry on our birthday. 
<Q> Looking smart Bond! 
<Q> It’s him! 
<NOMI> Yes! M’s got eyes on Logan Ash. 
<TANNER> Go. 
<NOMI> Let me know what happens. 
<BLOFELD> How did that happen? 
<MAIN> Well, you live long enough... 
<BLOFELD> Yes. Look at us. Two old men in a hole trying to work out who’s playing tricks on us. 
<BLOFELD> She still loves you. Did you know that? And you broke her heart. And she betrayed you. 
<MAIN> She’s irrelevant. 
<BLOFELD> Oh I wouldn’t be so quick to dismiss. You said it yourself... she’s very good at hiding things. 
<MAIN> A name. Just give me a name. 
<BLOFELD> Madeleine. 
<MAIN> Please. Please, no games. 
<BLOFELD> Madeleine. 
<BLOFELD> But I don’t want you to leave. We’re just getting reacquainted. 
<BLOFELD> Alright, come. You were unusually patient. I need to give you something so you didn’t have to make all this way for nothing. 
<TANNER> Careful Bond.BLOFELD 
<BLOFELD> It was me. 
<MAIN> You destroyed Spectre? 
<BLOFELD> No. Vesper’s grave. Madeleine didn’t do a thing. It was all me. I knew you’d come visit it. I just needed to wait for the bon moment. She lead you straight there from the goodness of her heart. 
<MAIN> It doesn’t matter. 
<BLOFELD> Oh, but it does. She still does. Doesn’t she? 
<MAIN> This isn’t working. 
<TANNER> Keep going. 
<MAIN> Die. 
<BLOFELD> Mmmh? 
<MAIN> Die... Blofeld. Die. 
<TANNER> Jesus! Open the door! 
<TANNER> BOND! Bond! Open the door. Bond! 
<BLOFELD> Coo-coo! 
<TANNER> Who the hell do you think you are? 
<MAIN> Yes, yes, yes. I know how to interrogate an asset. 
<TANNER> This interrogation is over. 
<MAIN> Tanner, don’t lecture me. 
<TANNER> Bond, you have violated the most important rule in the whole bloody playbook. 
<Q> I’m going to need those I’m afraid. 
<TANNER> He’s dead. 
<Q> It’s a good thing you’re not actually related or you’d be dead too. 
<MAIN> How do I get this off? 
<Q> You don’t. You can’t. 
<Q> Nanobots aren’t just for Christmas. 
<Q> Once Heracles is in your system, it’s there forever. 
<MAIN> Did they find the car? 
<MONEYPENNY> We traced it but she abandoned it. They searched her flat. She hasn’t been home. Is she one of them? 
<MAIN> I don’t know. 
<MAIN> No. I don’t know her at all. 
<MAIN> No. 
<MADELEINE> Then why did you come? 
<MADELEINE> I didn’t think you would remember. 
<MAIN> I remember everything. 
<MAIN> You need to tell me who gave you that poison, Madeleine. 
<MADELEINE> Is he dead? 
<MAIN> Yes he’s dead. 
<MADELEINE> Good. 
<MAIN> He told me you didn’t betray me. 
<MADELEINE> I understand you’re not built to trust people. 
<MAIN> Neither are you. 
<MADELEINE> Then we were fools for trying. 
<MAIN> I wanted to. 
<MAIN> I don’t know if you wanted me to come here, why you tried to kill Blofeld or who gave you the poison to do it or how long you have been working for them, but I do know that for what felt like five minutes of my life I wanted everything with you. And it’s not because I didn’t trust . 
<MADELEINE> Do you know the worst thing about you? 
<MAIN> My timing? 
<MADELEINE> Don’t. 
<MAIN> My sense of humour. 
<MADELEINE> Don’t. 
<MAIN> What? 
<MADELEINE> You look... Beat. They look at each other. The chemistry is palpable. 
<MAIN> ...You look incredible. 
<MADELINE> This is Mathilde. 
<MAIN> Hello! I’m James. 
<TANNER> Sir, we’ve located Logan Ash. 
<M> Well done 007. 
<NOMI> Thank you Sir. Permission for a capture or kill? 
<M> Have we cleared this with the Americans? 
<NOMI> By the book, Sir. 
<M> Your predecessor was less deferential. 
<NOMI> To be fair Sir, Commander Bond gave me the lead. 
<M> Glad to see you two are getting along. 
<NOMI> Sir. 
<TANNER> Nothing I’m afraid, sir. 
<M> Thank you. 
<MADELEINE> If you hear anything what do you do? 
<MATHILDE> I hide. 
<MADELEINE> Very good. 
<MADELEINE> Dis bon nuit au monsieur 
<MATHILDE> Bon nuit. 
<MAIN> Bon nuit. 
<MAIN> Ok. But the blue eyes... 
<MADELEINE> She’s not yours. 
<MAIN> Ok. 
<MADELEINE> I have something to show you. 
<MAIN> Another child? 
<MAIN> What is it with your dad and secret rooms? Talk to me. 
<MADELEINE> I wanted to bring you here before... To tell you everything. 
<MADELEINE> Blofeld ordered my father to assassinate this family. 
<MAIN> And what does he want? 
<MADELEINE> Revenge? 
<MAIN> Who were they? 
<MADELEINE> Spectre’s poisoners. My father held a banquet for them, used their own recipe in the dessert - dioxin. They would have suffered, horribly. It scarred him for life. The family had an island. They called it the Poison Garden. 
<MAIN> So Blofeld took it from them and kept running it. 
<MAIN> And now this Safin has taken it back. 
<MAIN> There are a thousand reasons why we need to find this man. You just gave me a reason to kill him. 
<MATHILDE> I’m hungry. 
<MAIN> How is it? 
<MATHILDE> Not bad. 
<MAIN> Yes. 
<M> Bond. 
<Q> Yes. It’s part of a chain in disputed waters between Japan and Russia. There’s a chemical plant dating back to the second world war. 
<Q> It seems to have had quite a history. 
<TANNER> Sir, Japanese intelligence have reported suspicious activity on the island. Q, bring up the satellite images I just sent through. These were taken over the last few days. If that is Safin there... 
<M> Then Heracles is there too. 
<Q> Where do you need this plane Bond? 
<MAIN> Hang on Q. Did 007 manage to locate Logan Ash? 
<MONEYPENNY> She’s closing in on him. I’ll send you her location. 
<MAIN> I thought she was following Logan Ash, not me. 
<TANNER> What? She IS. 
<MONEYPENNY> James, where are you? 
<MATHILDE> Where are we going? 
<MADELEINE> We’re going on an adventure, darling. Hang on. 
<MAIN> Q, I am gonna need that plane quickly. At the Ørland NATO base. Do you think you can get it to me. 
<MAIN> Thank you. 
<MATHILDE> Maman. 
<MATHILDE> Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes? 
<MATHILDE> Maman, do mosquitoes have friends? 
<MADELEINE> I don’t know. 
<MATHILDE> I don’t think so. 
<MADELEINE> Hang on. 
<MAIN> Stay here. I’ll be back soon. Anybody comes through that door, you shoot them. Unless it’s me! 
<ASH> Nice moves Bond. Bond sees that the Defender is precariously balanced. 
<ASH> You won’t be able to stop him. So why don’t you help me out, brother? 
<MAIN> I had a brother. His name was Felix Leiter. 
<NOMI> Need a ride? 
<MAIN> Where have you been? 
<NOMI> Chasing after your lead. 
<NOMI> Ash? 
<MAIN> Dead. 
<NOMI> I didn’t know she had a daughter. 
<NOMI> Our plane. I’m coming with you. 
<MAIN> Thank you 007. 
<MAIN> Hello Q. 
<Q> Bond. 
<NOMI> Sorry to get you out of bed. 
<M> I hope they’re there. 
<MAIN> Thank you sir. 
<NOMI> Sir, permission for Commander Bond to be re-designated as 007. 
<M> Very well. Agreed. Good luck. 
<Q> Bond. Your watch. 
<Q> It contains a limited-radius electromagnetic pulse. It’ll short any circuit on a hard wired network, if you get close enough. 
<MAIN> And how strong is it? 
<Q> It’s fairly strong. 
<MAIN> Fairly strong. What’s that mean? 
<Q> Haven’t had the time to test it properly. Just be careful. 
<Q> Right this is QDAR. It’ll map the space as you move through it. 
<Q> Don’t touch that! He opens a drawer, brings out an injector tracking device. 
<Q> And smart blood will track you and your vitals. Bond you don’t mind a shot or two whilst at work. Shall we? 
<MAIN> Well, I haven’t had a drink for three or four... 
<MAIN> ...Ouch! ...hours. 
<NOMI> Wow. Doesn’t sound like you. 
<NOMI> Ow! 
<Q> I assume you know how the stealthy bird works. 
<MAIN> No. No idea. 
<NOMI> Gravity. 
<VALDO> Welcome back Mr Safin. Welcome to your family. 
<SAFIN> How are you progressing? 
<VALDO> So, so good, Mr Safin. So, so good. 
<SAFIN> My request. 
<SAFIN> Continue. 
<MADELEINE> What is that? 
<SAFIN> Insurance. A simple hair falls from your head... And now I have your life in my hands He looks at Mathilde. 
<SAFIN> And yours! 
<MADELEINE> How damaged you must be to threaten a little girl. 
<SAFIN> You’re any less damaged? You love a killer. You bore his child despite his rejection, you’ve hidden and lied your whole life. You’ll do anything- 
<SAFIN> You understand me the same way I understand you. 
<PRIMO> Move. 
<SAFIN> My father’s garden. It was his toxic treasure. Let me show her. Give her to me. 
<SAFIN> I can protect her. 
<MADELEINE> Remember what I told you. Don’t touch anything. Okay? 
<SAFIN> It’s a poison garden but it’s perfectly safe. My father made this. He loved his plants so much, he would sing to them. I want to show you some of my favourites. 
<MADELEINE> Mathilde! No! 
<SAFIN> This one makes you do as you’re told, so you never misbehave and you’re always good. You mustn’t misbehave, Mathilde. 
<SAFIN> And neither must your mother. Ever. 
<SAFIN> Do you like it here? 
<MATHILDE> No. 
<SAFIN> Well you will learn to. I grew up here and you will too. Such a beautiful child. Perhaps we should have some tea. 
<MADELEINE> No. YOU CAN’T SEPARATE US. MATHILDE. 
<MATHILDE> Maman... 
<MAIN> You ever flown one of these things before? 
<NOMI> Nope. 
<NOMI> Coming up for air, Q. 
<M> Yes, we have it. 
<MONEYPENNY> Which one’s Bond? 
<Q> Right. You’re at the edge of a toxic merry-go-round. The main activity should be towards the central hub which is directly above you. 
<Q> Bond. Bond, there’s something... there’s something big up ahead. I can’t tell... 
<NOMI> These walls must be thick. 
<Q> Bond? Bond? 007, do you read me? 
<M> We’ve lost them. 
<Q> They’ve entered a blind spot, sir. I can’t work out what it is they’ve walked into. 
<M> Just get them back. 
<NOMI> This was a missile silo. 
<MAIN> Right. Let’s go. 
<MAIN> Everybody, over there. In the corner, now! 
<VALDO> What? How? 
<MAIN> Move! Move! On the ground. 
<VALDO> ALARM! 
<NOMI> Down boy. 
<VALDO> What are you doing? You cannot explode laboratory, please. This is suicide mission. Come on, you will never leave this island alive. 
<MAIN> And this is the factory. 
<MAIN> They’re mass producing it. Nomi, come and look at this. 
<VALDO> You cannot stop it mister. We have BIG plans, you know... BIG numbers. 
<NOMI> What is it? 
<MAIN> It’s a simulation. They’re not just attacking individuals. 
<NOMI> They’re going to kill millions. 
<VALDO> It will not fit in a suitcase this time lady. 
<NOMI> He’s really getting on my nerves. 
<MAIN> Well shut him up. 
<VALDO> Mr Safin! They use explosives... 
<NOMI> Shut up! 
<MAIN> Safin. Where is he? 
<MAIN> If I don’t come back, blow it all to shit. 
<NOMI> We don’t have enough explosives for that. 
<MAIN> Yeah but they don’t know that. 
<PRIMO> He said you must drink. For your health. 
<PRIMO> I think he wants you to drink. 
<MADELEINE> I want him to give me my daughter back. 
<PRIMO> He said if you behave you’ll see her. 
<MADELEINE> Do you know what this flower does? 
<MADELEINE> It makes you blind. 
<MADELEINE> Just a drop of this in your eyes. And you’ll never see again. 
<MADELEINE> Losing one eye is a tragedy. Losing two...? 
<PRIMO> No games. 
<MADELEINE> This is not a game. 
<SAFIN> On the floor. 
<SAFIN> And your sidearm. Bond hesitates. Safin references Mathilde -- 
<SAFIN> Careful. She’s as light as a feather. Safin tosses a cushion. It flies in the air and then explodes in a barrage of SILENCED GUNFIRE from the GUARD behind SAFIN. 
<MAIN> Alright! 
<SAFIN> Please, sit. 
<MAIN> It’s going to be alright. I promise you it’s going to be alright. 
<MAIN> We’ve made slightly different choices. 
<SAFIN> No, we’ve just developed different methods for the same goal. Only your skills die with your body, mine will survive long after I’m gone. And life is all about leaving something behind, isn’t it? He smiles at Mathilde. 
<SAFIN> This doesn’t have to get ugly. You leave my baby alone, I’ll leave yours. What you think? Beat. 
<MAIN> I think you’re right. 
<SAFIN> Thank you. 
<MAIN> I think we are the same. Beat. Safin says nothing. 
<MAIN> We both know what it feels like to have everything taken from us, before we’re even in the fight. 
<SAFIN> And you don’t? We both eradicate people to make the world a better place. I just want to be a little... tidier. Without collateral. I want the world to evolve. Yet you want it to stay the same. Let’s face it, I’ve made you redundant. 
<MAIN> No. Not as long as there are people like you in the world. And with all due respect to the enormity of your ‘tidy’ achievements all you’re really doing is standing in a very long line of angry little men. 
<SAFIN> I’m not angry, just passionate. 
<MAIN> And Madeleine? 
<SAFIN> She stays. 
<MAIN> You have her tell me that. 
<SAFIN> What mother wouldn’t sacrifice herself for her own child? 
<MAIN> Is that what happened to yours? 
<SAFIN> My mother lay at my feet as I watched her die. Safin grips Mathilde, as if we were going to throw her like the cushion -- 
<MAIN> Wait, wait, wait! Safin hesitates -- 
<MAIN> I’ll do whatever you want. 
<SAFIN> Yes you will. Bond bows, thinking quickly -- 
<MAIN> I apologise. I’m sorry. 
<SAFIN> Simple choices Mr. Bond. Like do you want to die in front of your daughter... 
<SAFIN> This is power. 
<MAIN> I’m sorry. Truly. Truly sorry. 
<MATHILDE> My Dou Dou. 
<SAFIN> If you don’t want my protection, then off you go. 
<SAFIN> Move! Our first buyers are arriving. 
<Q> Sir, I’ve just detected some suspicious activity. 
<M> Come on Bond. Where the hell are you. 
<VALDO> This is a hopeless situation, lady. Please. 
<NOMI> Bond. Bond, the party is larger than the reservation. 
<VALDO> Lady, look. Just give up. I have a good vial for your people. Good for West African diaspora. It can be a good thing. 
<VALDO> I do not need laboratory to exterminate your entire race from the face of the earth. 
<NOMI> Do you know what time it is? 
<VALDO> What? 
<NOMI> Time to die. 
<MAIN> They dropped down to a lower level. There has be a stairwell down... They hear something and turn back. 
<MATHILDE> I lost my little Dou Dou. 
<MADELEINE> I looked for you all over. Where were you? 
<MATHILDE> I hid like you told me. I love you. 
<MADELEINE> Me too. I love you. 
<MAIN> We should go. 
<Q> It’s Q. Do you read me? Come in 007. It’s Q. 
<Q> I think we just got buzzed. 
<TANNER> I understand and I’m doing the best that I can. Just please wait. 
<M> Don’t tell them anything just yet. 
<NOMI> Just in time. 
<MAIN> Nomi... you know Madeleine, Mathilde. They’re my... 
<MAIN> Q, Q are you there? 
<Q> Yes Bond. 
<MAIN> Do we have any Royal naval vessels in the immediate vicinity? 
<MAIN> We’re going to need an immediate strike on this location. This whole island is a manufacturing plant for Heracles. 
<TANNER> We don’t have clearance for missile strikes... do we? 
<Q> Bond, there’s something else you should know. Several unidentified ships are headed your way. 
<NOMI> They’re coming after Heracles. How far out? 
<Q> Twenty minutes. 
<M> Q. Patch me through. 007? 
<MAIN> M? 
<M> Our operation is attracting a lot of international attention. We’re seeing what we can do. 
<MAIN> It’s going to be very cold out there so I want you to have this to keep you warm. 
<MAIN> I have to finish this. For us. 
<MADELEINE> I know. 
<MAIN> I’ll just be a minute. 
<NOMI> I’ve got them. 
<MAIN> Thank you. 
<MAIN> Q. Talk to me. Q Our uninvited guests are fifteen minutes away. Bond takes cover as guards fire at him. Gunfire throughout rest of scene as he pushes forward. He takes out ONE. 
<Q> Find the control room. It should be in a tower just above the blast doors. The missiles will take about nine minutes from launch. Do you think you can do it before the ships arrive. 
<MAIN> Plenty of time. Plenty of time. 
<MAIN> Yeah... Q. I read you. 
<MAIN> I just showed someone your watch. It really blew their mind. 
<MAIN> Well my Russian is a little rusty but I think so, yeah. 
<MAIN> Okay Q. 
<MAIN> ...Power. 
<Q> You’re looking for a control panel. There should be a counterweight clutch. Listen very carefully 007. 
<Q> The first thing you need to do is to... 
<MAIN> Gottit! I think. 
<MAIN> Q. Tell M to launch the missiles now. 
<Q> Okay. Okay. Understood. M? Bond says fire. 
<M> Admiral? 
<M> M here. 
<M> You have permission to launch. 
<MAIN> No... no, no, no, no, no! 
<SAFIN> Quite a mess you’ve made. Like an animal. 
<SAFIN> Now we’re both poisoned with heartbreak. 
<SAFIN> You made me do this. This was your choice. 
<MAIN> Q? Q, are you there? 
<MAIN> Are they safe Q? 
<MAIN> There’s a slight problem with the blast doors. Won’t take a second. 
<MAIN> Q, how do I destroy this thing? 
<MAIN> No, no. If you get it on you how do you get it off? 
<MAIN> Well, that’s not gonna work. 
<MAIN> It’s alright Q. It’s alright. Would you put Madeleine on, please? 
<NOMI> Madeleine. 
<MAIN> Madeleine. 
<MADELEINE> I’m here. Where are you? Is it done? James? 
<MAIN> Yes, yes. He’s dead. Are you both there? 
<MADELEINE> Yes. 
<MAIN> Good. You’re safe. That’s good. 
<MADELEINE> Have you left? 
<MAIN> No. 
<MADELEINE> What? 
<MAIN> No. 
<MADELEINE> But you promised. 
<MAIN> Madeleine. 
<MADELEINE> Just get off that island. I know you can do this. Everything is good now. There’s no one left to hurt us. 
<MADELEINE> Oh God! The vial. You’ve been poisoned? 
<MAIN> Yes. 
<MADELEINE> There must be a way. We just need more time. If we only had more time. 
<MAIN> You have all the time in the world. 
<MADELEINE> I love you. 
<MAIN> I love you too. 
<MADELEINE> She does have your eyes. 
<MAIN> I know. 
<MAIN> I know. 
<M> And I thought this was appropriate. 
<M> The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. 
<M> Right. Back to work. 
<MADELEINE> Mathilde, I need to tell you a story. 
<MATHILDE> Quoi? 
<MADELEINE> I’m going to tell you a story. 
<MADELEINE> About a man. Madeleine drives. Thinking. She smiles. 
<MADELEINE> His name was Bond. James Bond.
