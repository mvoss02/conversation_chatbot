<MAIN> Oh bullshit! You saw the surveillance videotape. Your client’s slip and fall was the biggest acting job since I took the stage in eighth grade as Othello. And I blew! 
<MAIN> Great. Talk to your client. 
<WOMAN> Eight years of marriage all shot to hell. 
<JEREMY> Had I known you eight years ago I would have advised you to avoid the wedding. 
<JEREMY> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you say the "institution?" No, no. The Boston Red Sox are an institution. Pastrami on rye is an institution. Mr. Rogers is an institution -- Marriage is a curse. Our punishment for original sin. 
<JEREMY> Do you understand the ugliness I see here every day? The sheer torment? The absolute hell? Just because people like you -- and God bless your innocent heart, really believe in the "institution" of marriage! 
<WOMAN> My parents were happily married. 
<JEREMY> No. They really weren’t. You think they were. But they really weren’t. 
<WOMAN> They weren't? 
<WOMAN> Mom did drink -- quite a lot. 
<JEREMY> Of course she did. They all do. 
<MAIN> So what's up?
<JEREMY> Happy Anniversary. 
<MAIN> Huh? 
<JEREMY> Fifteen years, my friend! 
<JEREMY> June 11, 1988? Paul Revere High? Junior Prom night? 
<MAIN> Ohhhh. Right. Yeah. The night we met. 
<JEREMY> Could you sound more underwhelmed? 
<MAIN> I’m not underwhelmed. 
<JEREMY> You took Barbara Rothstein to the prom and wound up in the men's room making out with another girl. 
<MAIN> And you were in the stall next to me making, out with some chick who was not your date. Who was your date? 
<JEREMY> Mary Theresa Spinolli. Don't you remember? Turned out she was cheating on me! 
<MAIN> Ohhh. That's right. 
<JEREMY> I knew that night that you and I were cut from the same cloth. Best friends forever. 
<MAIN> A lot on my mind. 
<JEREMY> You think it's gay, don't you? The anniversary thing -- 
<MAIN> I don't think it's gay. 
<JEREMY> Because you forgot on our tenth, too. Remember I got you that beer- of-the-month ciub thing? 
<MAIN> Yeah, that was great. The beer. 
<JEREMY> You thought it was gay. 
<MAIN> I didn't think it was gay, for Christ's sake! It was beer! 
<JEREMY> Then how come you never get me anything for our anniversary? 
<MAIN> Okay -- what you said right there? That was a little gay. 
<JEREMY> Oh, fuck you. Anyway, we’ve got a big three weeks ahead of us. 
<MAIN> Yeah. End of the wedding season. How many weddings are we gonna crash? 
<JEREMY> I've got us down for eight. 
<MAIN> Any of them cash bars? 
<JEREMY> Two. But I got it covered,
<MAIN> Perfect. 
<JEREMY> Eight opportunities to get laid, my friend. Eight opportunities to score with women so aroused by the thought of marriage they mistakenly hook on to us as the men of their dreams. 
<MAIN> Bingo. I'll get my tux. 
<MAIN> Hi, Lou Epstein. 
<JEREMY> Chuck Schwartz. 
<MAIN> Jimmy O' Shea. 
<JEREMY> Tommy Fitzpatrick.
<MAIN> Henry Prajshnap. 
<JEREMY> Chuck Vindaloo. 
<BLONDE> Wow. Mt. Everest. 
<MAIN> Don’t really like to talk about it. We lost a lot of good men out there. 
<JEREMY> Don't really like to talk about it. We lost a lot of good men out there.
<BRUNETTE> Wow. The New York Yankees. 
<MAIN> Don't really like to talk about it. We lost a lot of good men out there. 
<BRUNETTE> Huh? 
<MAIN> What? Oh! The fans got unruly -- and there were trades -- it was ugly. 
<JEREMY> John, I am holding the Kentucky Derby of wedding announcements! 
<MAIN> I thought we were done for a while? 
<JEREMY> This is different. This is the Secretary of the fucking Treasury!! 
<MAIN> Cleary? 
<JEREMY> Yes, Cleary's daughter! Out on the Cape! 
<MAIN> Mm hmm. 
<MAIN> Okay -- Jeremy stares at him. 
<JEREMY> "Okay?!" See? This is what I'm talking about! 
<MAIN> I'm tired, all right?! My feet hurt. My voice is hoarse. 
<JEREMY> You don't care about this anymore! 
<MAIN> What are you talking about? Of course I care! 
<JEREMY> At the Buckner nuptials, you were in the corner, sulking! 
<MAIN> I wasn’t sulking! I twisted my ankle. 
<JEREMY> Rule six: Don't sit in the corner and. sulk. It draws attention in a negative way. Draw attention to yourself oil your own terms! 
<MAIN> I know the rules, Jeremy! 
<JEREMY> When Chazz Reinghold gave us those sacred rules of wedding crashing twelve years ago, he passed on a legacy. We have a responsibility here. 
<MAIN> You know, you make it sound like a cult. Chazz Reinghold was a kook!
<JEREMY> Bite your tongue! He was not kook! He was, a brave and decent man! 
<MAIN> He lived with his mother until he was forty! She tried to poison his oatmeal! Even she couldn’t take it! 
<JEREMY> That was never proven! And anyway, what about Rule Three?! Rule Three for Chrissakes, John! 
<MAIN> Oh not that again -- 
<JEREMY> Rule Three: Toast in the native language if you know the native language and have practiced the toast. Do not wing it! Last week you when you toasted the groom in Hindi -- 
<MAIN> Ok! I got a couple of words mixed up. Big deal! 
<JEREMY> A couple of words mixed up?! You told the entire wedding party that the bride was very lucky because her new husband smelled like the anus of the cobra! 
<MAIN> I meant, he had the power -- of the -- cobra! Okay?! -- anyway I managed to turn that into a compliment, did I not?! 
<JEREMY> Oh please -- So do you want to do this or not? 
<MAIN> Give me the paper. 
<MAIN> 
<JEREMY> There's my man. He's back. My man is back! 
<MAIN> Okay, let's do our pre-game. 
<JEREMY> What's to know? Big Catholic wedding. Lots of rich fuckers. Hot chicks. We can do this in our sleep. 
<MAIN> Rule one: Always prepare. 
<JEREMY> Fine. What do you have? 
<MAIN> A few articles on Secretary Cleary's economic policy. Skim them quickly. Also a roster of the key family members. A glossary of sailing terms. Sailing's like sex to these people. 
<JEREMY> Okay -- Harvard -- Kennedy School of Government -- Mom's big with the charities blah blah blah. Three daughters, one son, a million foundations. Barf. Puke. Gag. Okay. Got it. What's our back story? 
<JEREMY> I'm sick of that one. Why don't we be from -- Vermont and -- and have, say, an emerging maple syrup conglomerate. 
<MAIN> Because we don't know anything about maple syrup. 
<JEREMY> I know everything about maple syrup. I love maple syrup. 
<MAIN> I love red vines. Doesn't mean we should be the red vine barons, right? 
<JEREMY> Good point. 
<MAIN> I knew it! Secret Service. 
<JEREMY> Yeah. So? 
<MAIN> So they don't mess around. They're trained to take bullets. 
<JEREMY> Big deal. I could take bullets. 
<MAIN> Oh, please. You-won't even get a flu shot. Maybe we should catch that Portuguese wedding down in New Bedford. They'll have, those sausages you like. 
<MAIN> Fine. How do you want to get in? 
<JEREMY> Okay. Let me think. 
<MAIN> Guarded. 
<JEREMY> Shit! 
<MAIN> Not with these guys. Disturbances just hype their radar. 
<JEREMY> Okay, then what do you got? 
<MAIN> Let's just rush in with this big group. 
<JEREMY> A rush?! You want to do a rush? 
<MAIN> Yeah, what's wrong with a rush? 
<JEREMY> It's amateur hour, buddy. It's bush league. We' re better than a rush. 
<MAIN> It'll work. 
<MAIN> Go! 
<MAIN> Five rows back. Close enough to the altar but far enough back to see the bride's entrance. 
<MAIN> Now, a lot of people go for the aisle. That's a mistake. You have that whole "should I make eye contact with the bride" business. 
<MAIN> You don’t want that. It's awkward. Fifth row back, second seat in. Trust me. 
<MAIN> I have to hit the head. 
<MAIN> Yeah, I know what you’re thinking. 
<MAIN> You're thinking, "What have I done? I’m over. I’m finished. Now it ends." And at what? Twenty-six? 
<MAIN> Twenty-six years of pure uncut premium Grade- А sexual freedom. Yeah, it’s a drug. A drug that makes morphine look like skittles, and it's going right down the toilet as you descend into the abyss of country kitchens, dirty diapers, mind-numbing conversation about her "needs" and worse, the same sex with the same person, day after day, night after night, year in, year out. 
<MAIN> Well, you’re wrong. It's-not like that. You see it as the beginning of the end. No, my friend! It's the end of the beginning -- The groom looks up, encouraged. 
<MAIN> 
<MAIN> Someone you never have to impress, but always want to. Most men would give up their left arm to be in your shoes. 
<GROOM> Thank you -- 
<MAIN> No problem. 
<GROOM> Hey, how long have you been married? 
<JEREMY> Third row. Straw hat. 
<MAIN> You know that women who wear hats never give it up. C'mon! 
<JEREMY> What? That’s not true! I bagged that hat chick at the Martingano wedding! 
<MAIN> A little louder. I don't think the Priest heard you. 
<MAN> Frank Myers. 
<MAIN> John Ryan. This is my brother Jeremy. 
<FRANK> So, how do you know the groom? 
<MAIN> Oh, we’re -- 
<FRANK> Uncle Ned? Is he Liz's brother? 
<MAIN> Yeah -- Liz's brother. 
<FRANK> Great. How is everybody? 
<MAIN> Oh really. Dad's fine. Aunt Liz sends her best. She couldn't make it. 
<FRANK> Uh -- I know. She's dead. 
<JEREMY> She sends her best from the grave. We've become very spiritual. 
<FRANK> I see -- Franks smiles and turns away. 
<JEREMY> How many times are you gonna do this? If you're going to commit to a relative, be sure make you know whether they have a pulse. 
<JEREMY> Hello. 
<MAIN> All yours, my friend. 
<MAIN> I think we've got a crier. 
<JEREMY> Nah -- 
<MAIN> Twenty bucks? 
<JEREMY> You’re on. 
<JEREMY> Jesus -- Jeremy reaches into his wallet and hands John a twenty.
<MAIN> Twenty bucks says it's First Corinthians. 
<JEREMY> No way. Colossians. 3:12. 
<GLORIA> A reading from Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians. 
<GLORIA> "Love is patient. Love is kind--” 
<JEREMY> Love is bullshit. Love' sucks dick. 
<JEREMY> I just love to see young people happy. 
<GROOM> I Craig, take you Catherine to be my wife, my best friend, and my first mate. 
<GROOM> To captain our ship of love and to stay with that ship no matter how rough the seas. 
<GROOM> Through health and sickness, clear skies and squalls. 
<GROOM> You are the star I set my course to. You are my magnetic north. My sextant always point to you. 
<CLAIRE> Sorry. Tickle in my throat. Please continue.
<JEREMY> Well, this is a first. 
<MAIN> She 1s amazing -- The bride places a ring on the groom's finger. 
<BRIDE> I Christina take you, Craig, to be my husband, my best friend, and my Captain. 
<BRIDE> To be your anchor and your sail, your starboard.and your port, your bow and your stern. 
<BRIDE> Your life, your love, your lady, and the sea. 
<JEREMY> Sweet, huh? What did I tell you? 
<MAIN> You said it would be sweet. 
<MAIN> Get us seats near -- but not too near -- the bridal party. I'll drop the fake present. 
<JEREMY> Excellent. And if you see any crab cakes, grab me sortie. Got to have some crab cakes. 
<JEREMY> Sorry Mr, and Mrs. Burgess. I'm sure we’ll find you another lovely table. 
<MAIN> Fondue set.
<CLAIRE> Excuse me? 
<MAIN> The present you’re holding. It's a sterling silver fondue set. 
<MAIN> John Ryan. 
<CLAIRE> Claire Cleary. 
<MAIN> Sort of a psychic. 
<CLAIRE> Really? 
<MAIN> Knife set. Very nice. German. 
<MAIN> Cotton linens, Egyptian. 
<MAIN> Place setting. Candlesticks. Crystal Stemware -- which they’ll never use by the way and, I have to say, is bad karma. 
<MAIN> Massage oils and a book on Tantra. Probably from the wackv Aunt. 
<MAIN> Yes. Unfortunately, my powers only apply to useless consumer products. 
<CLAIRE> Well, look, if one day, the police need someone to find a missing Belgian waffle maker, you’re there. 
<KATHLEEN> Claire, we need you for pictures. 
<CLAIRE> This is John Ryan. 
<MAIN> You remembered my name. Very good. 
<CLAIRE> I have a gift. 
<JEREMY> You must try the bacon wrapped scallops. 
<MAIN> Will do. 
<JEREMY> Quick hide me!
<MAIN> Too late. We’ll do number ten from the playbook. 
<WOMAN> Shlomo?! I thought you were renouncing your possessions arid moving to Nepal. 
<WOMAN> Shlomo? Don't you remember me? 
<MAIN> Oh, God, I'm sorry. You didn’t hear, I guess. Shlomo had a bad accident. In the Himalayas. Sherpas, pack mules. Oxygen deprivation. He doesn't remember anyone. Even me, his own brother. I'm just some nice man who helps him out. 
<WOMAN> Oh, you poor dear. 
<MAIN> I'm afraid, he can't hear you. Part of the accident. You here for the Cleary Wedding? 
<WOMAN> Yes, but I have to leave. I've got a flight to Madrid. 
<WOMAN> But I could hang out for a few minutes, 
<MAIN> Fine. We'll get you the crab cakes first. 
<WOMAN> Here’s my number if there's anything I can do to help. 
<JEREMY> Cool. In a couple of weeks I'll have you call her for me. Guaranteed score. Deaf-mute amnesiac. They love that, I won't even have to buy her dinner. 
<MAIN> Charming. So what angle are you going to work here? 
<JEREMY> Oh -- I'll think I start with a public balloon animal display for the kids and then, when that chick draws near, do the man-haunted-by- noble-past. 
<MAIN> Excellent. 
<JEREMY> You? 
<JEREMY> Beautiful. 
<MAIN> Let's do it. 
<JEREMY> Okay, who’s next? 
<JEREMY> A bike takes too many balloons. Uncle Jeremy's a little out of breath. How about a giraffe? Giraffe’s are cool. 
<KATHLEEN> Let's see how you do with someone your own age. 
<MAIN> I think I’m up to the challenge, 
<MAIN> So, how long have you and the Secretary been married? 
<KATHLEEN> Oh, thirty years next April. 
<MAIN> Wow. 
<KATHLEEN> Ydah, and we were faithful for two of them. 
<GLORIA> You're good. 
<JEREMY> This is nothing. Yesterday I made my grandma a new house. Real nice one, too. With a pool. 
<GLORIA> Okay, then I’ll take a sports car. 
<JEREMY> Or how about a dance instead? 
<GLORIA> That's what I really wanted. 
<MAIN> Of course. Read it while I was sailing my boat to Bermuda. 
<MAIN> Are you kidding me? It was brilliant. Now if only Congress weren't so short-sighted. 
<MAIN> Nothing would make me happier, sir. 
<GLORIA> And you saved his life? 
<JEREMY> Yeah, some others weren't so lucky. It still shakes me up to talk about it. 
<GLORIA> I’m sorry. 
<JEREMY> It's okay. It's just -- we lost some really good men. 
<JEREMY> If you'll excuse me. I think I need to get some air. 
<MAIN> Thank you, sir. 
<FRANKLIN> Right away, sir. 
<MAIN> I'm sure he's, you know, just finding his way. 
<MAIN> Perhaps. 
<GLORIA> And so you dove into the icy water to save him? 
<JEREMY> Yeah, well, I'm sure anyone would do the same. 
<GLORIA> I’ve always wondered about this. It's so amazing to me. Why would a man risk his own life to save the life of someone he doesn't even know?
<JEREMY> Well, the great 19th century philosopher Schopenhauer asked that very question and this is how he answered it. He said that at that moment when a person sees another in danger, there is a breaking in of a metaphysical awareness. You know what that awareness is? 
<GLORIA> What? 
<JEREMY> That we are all one. That separateness is an illusion. That I am one with everyone. 
<JEREMY> The Prime Minister of England, my great Uncle Harry, you, me, the fat kid on "What's Happening," We are all one. 
<GLORIA> We are? 
<JEREMY> Yes. 
<JEREMY> Yes. 
<CLAIRE> We've met. He's psychic. 
<CLAIRE> You’re a big hit at this wedding. 
<MAIN> A lot of nice people here. 
<CLAIRE> Oh, they're full of shit. 
<MAIN> Excuse me? 
<CLAIRE> The only reason ninety-percent of these people are here is because of my Dad. They're all suckling at the power-teat. 
<MAIN> Yeah. Well, I’m here for the crabcakes and the power-teat. When is the suckling, by the way? After the first dance? 
<CLAIRE> I don't know. Everyone walking around trying to act like they care. It's awful. Plus the place is rife with lawyers. A gazillion lawyers. 
<MAIN> Not big on lawyers, huh? 
<CLAIRE> Hate 'em. I mean -- you're not one are you? 
<CLAIRE> Lawyers are by nature liars. And I hate liars. 
<CLAIRE> See? Suckling. 
<MAIN> Maybe, but I think most people come to weddings, even this one, because they want to believe they're in the presence of true love, that true love is possible. Even the lawyers. And the sucklers. 
<CLAIRE> True love, huh? And what is "true love,” John Ryan? 
<MAIN> Well -- true love is your soul's recognition of it's counterpoint in another. 
<CLAIRE> Well, that's a little grandiose. 
<MAIN> Perhaps. So are you giving a toast? 
<CLAIRE> Yes! Normally I'm terrible at these things, but I think this one's pretty good. 
<CLAIRE> I had to fight the urge to be completely honest. What do you think?
<MAIN> I think the urge won. 
<CLAIRE> What are you talking about?! 
<MAIN> You can’t say this. 
<CLAIRE> Why not? 
<MAIN> "I never thought my sister would find someone who cared about what people thought as much as she did. Until I met Craig." 
<CLAIRE> What?I It's funny. Funny because it's true. People like funny. 
<MAIN> No, see, the funny because-it’s- true bit only works if the truth is a small thing like "Tim's a little frugal" or "We all know Jennifer likes to shop. Ha. Ha," I mean, people are here for a wedding, not to see Don Rickies at the Sands. I'd give it a fifteen, maybe a twenty percent chance of a laugh. Not worth it. See, people want something from the heart. 
<CLAIRE> Well I think people are gonna love it. 
<MAIN> Nope, you're gonna get dead silence. Crickets. 
<CLAIRE> You're wrong. I'm going to stick with it. 
<MAIN> Fine. I'll be in the back of the room waiting to tell you I told you so.
<CLAIRE> I never thought my sister would find someone who cared about what people thought as much as she did. Until I met Craig. 
<CLAIRE> As you all know both my sister and Craig are lawyers at big firms in New York. But that’s not the only thing they have in common. You see, they both have the same favorite color. Green. 
<CLAIRE> Look, I'm sorry. I'm not really good at this sort of thing. 
<CLAIRE> 
<GLORIA> That's was so amazing. 
<JEREMY> Yeah, great. What do you say we head back? 
<GLORIA> I always knew my first time would be on the beach. I'm just so happy it was you. 
<JEREMY> Wait a minute. First time? 
<JEREMY> You were a virgin? 
<GLORIA> Mm-hrnm. Oh, Jeremy, we're gonna be so happy together. I love you. 
<CLAIRE> Thank you!
<MAIN> Now you know never to doubt me. 
<CLAIRE> God, it was exhilarating. It was -- She leans in the hug John but before she can, SACK rushes up to her. Sack, early thirties, is great looking,. Ivy League, rich, works for noble causes. The guy every guy hates. 
<SACK> Claire, you were awesome. 
<CLAIRE> John, this is my boyfriend, Sack. 
<MAIN> Nice to meet you. 
<SACK> Let’s dance. 
<CLAIRE> It was great meeting you. 
<MAIN> Yeah, you too. 
<JEREMY> Dude, we’ve got to get out of here. ASAP. I've got a stage five clinger. 
<MAIN> I need more time. 
<JEREMY> You're not hearing me. She's a stage five! A virgin clinger! I'll start the car. 
<JEREMY> Actually -- we're about to leave. It's been a lovely wedding. 
<MAIN> We'd love to. 
<JEREMY> What?I We don't have any other clothes! 
<JEREMY> But I promised my Granny I'd take her to the park. 
<GLORIA> And I'm sure daddy can hire somebody to take your Granny to the park.
<MAIN> Great! Done. 
<GLORIA> Jeremy, sweetie, I’m making lemonade. Interested? 
<JEREMY> Sure, sure. That'd be great, honey. 
<JEREMY> And could you put some heroin in it? John, this is against the rules! You've got a wedding and a reception tc seal the deal. Period. No overtime! 
<MAIN> Oh really? No overtime? Need I remind you of the Chung wedding, 1997? 
<JEREMY> All right, look -- 
<MAIN> We finished the reception. I'm ready to go home. Next thing you know, you're dragging me to watch you and some chick play mah-jongg with her grandmother thirty miles away at a retirement home. 
<JEREMY> I needed to do that, all right?! 
<JEREMY> She was into her grandma! You know the drill! 
<JEREMY> It was my first Asian! 
<MAIN> Look, I just need some alone time with her. 
<JEREMY> She's got a boyfriend. 
<MAIN> They all have boyfriends. So what? 
<JEREMY> Okay. Fine. Get some alone time, seal the deal and let's get the fuck away from these people. 
<SACK> Gentlemen. Everything okay? 
<MAIN> Oh yeah. Fine. 
<SACK> Oh man, will you check that out. A school of bluefish. 
<SACK> 
<MAIN> Yes we heard. 
<MAIN> Absolutely. 
<JEREMY> Great. 
<JEREMY> That's the "little place back on the Vineyard?" EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 51 51 Jeremy and John line up in a scrimmage with other guests including Claire, Cleary, and Sack. Todd, Claire's younger brother sits in a lawnchair on the sideline reading. 
<CLAIRE> Not fair’ You made me laugh! 
<MAIN> No, it's not fair. Yet a lot of things in life aren't fair. 
<CLAIRE> Hey, is your friend okay? 
<SACK> I don’t know what got into me.
<MAIN> Are you all right? 
<TODD> You must be joking. 
<JEREMY> It's ok. It’s ok. Um, perhaps Todd could donate a kidney instead. 
<JEREMY> Good, good. I'm better now. Second down. 
<SACK> Damn! What in the world is wrong with me?! 
<MAIN> You all right? 
<JEREMY> Um -- I may need you to perform the Heimlich maneuver. I think I'm choking on my own nuts. Do we get to leave now? 
<MAIN> No. 
<KATHLEEN> Honey, let's take him in the house and get him fixed up. 
<GLORIA> Sure, Mom. 
<KATHLEEN> It's so hot out. Why don't you play in your underwear? 
<MAIN> Umm -- 
<KATHLEEN> Think about it. I'll make you a drink. 
<JEREMY> Ah man! That stings! 
<GLORIA> Ohhh, poor baby. Want me to blow -- on it? 
<JEREMY> It’s fine. 
<GLORIA> You know, I'm not wearing panties. 
<RANDOLPH> Oh, don't worry, little Gloria. Mum's the word. 
<GLORIA> Thank you, Randolph. 
<RANDOLPH> A little more discreet though, okay? 
<JEREMY> Oh Jesus -- 
<GLORIA> Don't worry. He won't say anything. Now where were we? Oh right, I'm not wearing panties. 
<JEREMY> It's like eight hours ago you were a shy virgin. Now you're not wearing panties? 
<GLORIA> You do that to me.
<JEREMY> Gloria, look, I'm tired. It's been a long day. Not to mention that your sister's boyfriend made a smoothy with my nards. I'm not exactly in the mood. 
<GLORIA> Fine. 
<JEREMY> Aaaaaarrrrrrrrgh! 
<GLORIA> My Father warned me about people like you! I'm just another notch on your belt! 
<JEREMY> No, no, it's not like that! 
<GLORIA> What's it like then, Jeremy?! Huh?! Huh?! 
<JEREMY> It's like -- She takes another load of medicine and tortures another wound. 
<JEREMY> Aaaaaaaarrrrrrgh! 
<GLORIA> You're my knight, in shining armor. 
<GLORIA> Don't ever leave me. 
<JEREMY> Oh no. Never. Don't you worry -- 
<GLORIA> Good. 
<GLORIA> I sure did, Daddy. 
<JEREMY> Oh well -- yeah. 
<JEREMY> Oh no, no. Of course not, sir. 
<JEREMY> Right -- yes, sir. 
<MAIN> Jer, you have the visine? 
<JEREMY> No’ Not the visine! It’s too early! 
<MAIN> I need the visine, goddamit. Give it to me! 
<JEREMY> You know the rules. The visine is a last resort. The visine's a fucking felony. 
<MAIN> I can't get any alone time with her. The guy won't leave her side. I need the visine. 
<SACK> -- so when I picked up the little sea otter and wiped the oil off him from the tanker spill, I swear he - - smiled. It was a little -- otter smile. You know, all teeth, the whiskers kind of pert -- ANGLE ON: Jeremy and John. Jeremy reaches into his pocket. 
<JEREMY> Okay, here's the visine. 
<SACK> I brought them from an organic scallop farm right off Nauggesett.
<CLAIRE> Yeah, Sack talked the Governor into subsidizing part of the project. 
<SACK> Yup. Now, it's the state’s only self-sustaining scallop farm. 
<MAIN> Say that five times fast. 
<JEREMY> I bet they’re tasty. Maybe I'll try them when my jaw heals. 
<SACK> Again, I'm sorry, Jeremy. It's that damn competitive streak. I’m seeing a Buddhist about it. 
<JEREMY> Really? I'm seeing a orthopedist when I get back to-town. Not just any orthopedist. Dr. Epstein -- 
<MAIN> Enough, ok? 
<SACK> Uh -- I don't know. What's it been, Claire? A couple of years? 
<CLAIRE> Three and a half. 
<SACK> Anyway, John, tell me how you're connected to the family again? 
<MAIN> Uncle Ned's kids. 
<JEREMY> You know -- Uncle Ned? The brother of -- Aunt Liz? 
<SACK> Uh-huh -- We see Gloria reach her hand under the table and grab Jeremy's crotch. Jeremy's eyes bug out. He tries to push her arm away. Gloria, her arm hidden by the table cloth, begins to furiously masturbate Jeremy. 
<JEREMY> That’s right) John looks at him strangely, then looks down. He sees what's happening and gives Jeremy a shocked look. 
<CLAIRE> So is it just about money? 
<MAIN> Oh -- no, no! Not at all. It's about, you know, investing in projects that are both ethically and morally defensible. 
<SACK> Like what, for example? 
<CLAIRE> Cool -- 
<SACK> Mmm. What’s it called? 
<JEREMY> Holy sh -- 
<MAIN> Holy Shirts And Pants. 
<SACK> I don't feel so good. 
<MAIN> Great, great. 
<MAIN> Oh yes, Ma’am. 
<GLORIA> I’m so proud of yout willy. 
<CLAIRE> Grandma, you can't talk that way. You can’t feel that way. It's not right! 
<JEREMY> Yeah. Like Hitler. 
<CLAIRE> Grandma!
<MAIN> Ma'am, I have to tell you I happen to have a lot of very good friends who are Jewish. As does my brother. 
<JEREMY> Very close to the Jews. 
<MAIN> Yes. Really. 
<CLAIRE> Thank you. Finally someone speaks up. 
<SACK> I’ve gotta go. 
<CLAIRE> What's wrong, honey? 
<SACK> Gotta -- go.
<JEREMY> But his eyes are sure clear. 
<TODD> Oh, I don't eat meat or fish. 
<CLAIRE> Grandma! 
<CLAIRE> Todd's an amazing painter. He's going to the Rhode Island School of Design. 
<MAIN> Wow. That's very impressive. 
<TODD> Dad used to think I was a political liability, you know, in case he ever ran for President. 
<TODD> What is "our situation," Dad?! 
<KATHLEEN> Oh, for Chrissakes, William. Put Mommy to bed already! 
<TODD> I'll be in my room. Painting -- homo things. 
<KATHLEEN> You go right ahead, Toddy. 
<MAIN> So maybe after dinner we could take a walk? 
<CLAIRE> How about now? I can’t take this anymore. They're driving me crazy. 
<MAIN> Great! Let me just change my shoes. 
<CLAIRE> Irll be outside waiting. Hurry up. 
<MAIN> Absolutely. 
<KATHLEEN> I just got my tits done. 
<MAIN> Uh-huh. 
<KATHLEEN> Do you like them? 
<MAIN> Uh, yes. Those -- are great -- tits. 
<KATHLEEN> William doesn't appreciate my tits. 
<MAIN> Well, darn him. Mrs. Cleary, I don't think -- 
<KATHLEEN> Call me Kat. 
<MAIN> Okay, Kat, I don't think that -- 
<KATHLEEN> Call me Kitty-Kat. 
<MAIN> Uh, look -- Kitty-Kat -- I really don’t think this is appropriate -- She walks toward John and stands right over him. 
<KATHLEEN> Feel them. 
<MAIN> What?! 
<KATHLEEN> I said feel them. 
<MAIN> Mrs. Cleary -- 
<KATHLEEN> Kitty-Kat.
<MAIN> Kitty-Kat, are you out of your fucking mind? 
<KATHLEEN> I'm not letting you out of this room until you feel them. 
<MAIN> They're very nice. Okay? 
<KATHLEEN> We will be lovers before this weekend is up. 
<MAIN> What?! No! 
<TODD> It's okay. I can tell. You have that "Mom made me feel her tits" look on your face. Don't worry about it. She usually picks one male guest a weekend to sexually harass. 
<MAIN> Oh Jesus -- 
<TODD> Don't say anything to Dad, though. Some friend of my sister said something to Dad a couple of years ago and he now lives in Paraguay. And not by choice.
<MAIN> Good to know. 
<TODD> No problem -- John hurriedly continues down the hall. He runs into Jeremy, shuffling down the hall looking completely spent. 
<JEREMY> What's wrong? 
<MAIN> Nothing. I'm just trying to get outside to meet Claire. 
<JEREMY> You've got a weird look on your face. 
<MAIN> Claire's Mom made me grope her boobies, okay?! 
<JEREMY> Hmm. She get them done? They look pretty good. 
<MAIN> What's wrong with you? 
<JEREMY> What? I just asked -- 
<MAIN> Shut up! 
<JEREMY> You go enjoy yourself! I'm just gonna go spit up some blood and ice down my balls. 
<JEREMY> You're in my room. 
<JEREMY> What? 
<JEREMY> Uh, okay, sure. 
<CLAIRE> What took you so long? 
<MAIN> I’m sorry. I got -- 
<CLAIRE> Strange family, huh? 
<MAIN> Yeah -- a little. 
<CLAIRE> All right -- I’m coming. 
<CLAIRE> Sorry, John. Maybe we can find time tomorrow. 
<MAIN> Yeah, sure, tomorrow then. 
<MAIN> Hey, help him get better soon -- I saw some otters earlier and they were -- frowning. 
<CLAIRE> Be nice. 
<MAIN> Yeah. Great. I'll be right in. 
<MAIN> Fuck, fuck, fuck! 
<JEREMY> Oh, uh, okay -- I know this looks kind of strange -- 
<RANDOLPH> You're bangin' the daughter and the grandma?! How much jam you got, mon? 
<JEREMY> No no! It's not like that! 
<RANDOLPH> Listen, mon. The family dog lives downstairs. I can wake him up for you, too, if you like. 
<JEREMY> Look, you've got it totally wrong! 
<RANDOLPH> Just be gentle wit her, mon. Okay? She be pushing ninety. 
<RANDOLPH> Good God. It's a mutter-fucking freak show here -- INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 63 63 Jeremy is laying in bed tossing and turning. He's sore. 
<JEREMY> Hey! 
<JEREMY> What are you doing?! 
<GLORIA> Listen, I know what you were saying before and I started thinking that maybe I'm not being exciting and adventurous for you. 
<JEREMY> Gloria -- 
<GLORIA> Sssh. You'll wake everybody. 
<JEREMY> But -- She takes a sock and stuffs it in his mouth. 
<JEREMY> This is not my fantasy! 
<GLORIA> I love you -- INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS 68 68 John is walking down the hallway. He comes to Claire's door and listens to see if she's awake. 
<JEREMY> Gloria -- you have to go back to your room. 
<TODD> We had a moment at the dinner table, didn't we? 
<JEREMY> What are you talking about?! There was no moment. 
<TODD> Oh yeah, we had moment. 
<JEREMY> I was sitting right there. I think I would have noticed a moment -- 
<TODD> I made you a painting. 
<TODD> I call it "Tortured Scrotum." It's sexual and violent. Sort of a self- portrait. I thought you'd like it. 
<JEREMY> Oh wow -- that's, uh, something. Thank you -- so -- much. 
<TODD> Oh you're more than welcome. 
<JEREMY> Say listen, Todd, I haven't gotten much gosh-darned sleep tonight and hey, why don't we talk tomorrow? 
<TODD> Promise you'll make time for me? 
<JEREMY> Oh -- cross my heart.
<TODD> Okay -- you sleep. 
<JEREMY> Okay. Good enough. 
<JEREMY> Lord! How much more of this can I take?I INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING 75 75 John is at the breakfast table, eating some bacon, reading the newspaper, drinking coffee in a gargantuan kitchen. Jeremy stumbles, exhausted, into the kitchen. A COOK is making all kinds of breakfast things. He pours Jeremy some coffee and exits. 
<MAIN> You know they’ll make you anything you want here? Waffles, bacon, whatever -- 
<JEREMY> Oh that’s swell, John. 
<MAIN> What’s your problem? 
<JEREMY> What’s my problem? Oh, I didn't sleep too well. 
<MAIN> Why not? 
<JEREMY> Well, besides the bone-crushing pain and the midnight rape, there was a nude gay art show at 4 a.m. 
<MAIN> Phew. Red Sox are taking it in the shorts. 
<JEREMY> I'm taking it in the shorts! 
<JEREMY> I'm too traumatized for toast! 
<JEREMY> Look, I'm going to say.this as nicely as possible: if we don't get the fuck out of here right now I'm going to kill you. 
<MAIN> Can't do it. 
<JEREMY> Why not?! 
<MAIN> I need another day. 
<JEREMY> For what?! She's got a boyfriend. Plus, her own mental hospital here to entertain him! 
<MAIN> Sssh! Keep it down! I think Claire's into me. Plus, the boyfriend's a complete tool. 
<JEREMY> Okay, we think the boyfriend's a -- tool. Maybe the whole world thinks the boyfriends a tool. But if she's doesn't think the boyfriend’s a tool then the game's over. 
<MAIN> The game's never over. 
<JEREMY> John, the rules are really clear about boyfriends and -- JOHN
<JEREMY> “Fuck the rules?” How can you say that?! You’re a very insensitive man. 
<MAIN> This isn't about the rules, okay?! This is about love! 
<JEREMY> Love?! 
<MAIN> Oh Jesus -- 
<JEREMY> Come on! How can it be love? You've known her for a day. 
<MAIN> I don't know, Jeremy. I can't explain it. Chemical? Fate? I don't know. I just know! 
<JEREMY> Fine. I understand. I'm outta here. Good luck. 
<MAIN> No, no, no. You can’t leave! 
<JEREMY> Why not?! 
<MAIN> Because that’ll create a huge shitstorm with Gloria! It'll focus the attention there! 
<MAIN> I need you to help me. I mean what do the rules say about abandonment? 
<JEREMY> "Never leave a fellow crasher stranded. Wedding crashers take care of their own." 
<MAIN> That’s right. 
<JEREMY> I hate you -- 
<MAIN> Have some more toast. 
<JEREMY> I want a waffle. 
<MAIN> Good! That’s good. 
<TRAP> Hello? 
<SACK> Trapster, it’s Sack.
<TRAP> Sack-Master! What’s the word? How was the wedding? 
<SACK> It was great. Fine. Whatever. Listen, I need background on two guys the Secretary invited out here for the weekend. John and Jeremy Ryan. 
<TRAP> Okay, John and Jeremy Ryan. 
<SACK> They're brothers. A couple of venture capital weasels from New Hampshire. Got some kind of NPO called Holy Shirts and Pants. 
<TRAP> Oh -- venture capitalists, they’re the worst. 
<SACK> Tell my girlfriend's father. He practically shot his cabinet level wad over these two. 
<TRAP> It's all about the money with guys like that. Sick, sick, sick. 
<SACK> Preaching to the choir, brother. 
<TRAP> Hey, listen when you get a chance you need to come into the firm so we can restructure your trust fund. 
<SACK> Oh right, right. Will do. 
<TRAP> And I'll look into these guys -- see what their story is. 
<SACK> Cool. I'm seeing Billygoat on Tuesday so Г ’11 tell him. 
<TRAP> You da' man. 
<SACK> You da' bigger man. 
<CLAIRE> I don't know -- 
<MAIN> Poor guy's probably still not feeling well. That flu usually lasts about two days. 
<SACK> Wait! I'm coming. 
<MAIN> Oh good. Here he comes. 
<CLAIRE> Are you all right, honey? Maybe you should go down in the cabin and lie down. 
<SACK> No, I'll be fine. So, John, where'd you say you guys were from up there in New Hampshire? 
<MAIN> I didn't. But we're from Manchester. 
<SACK> Great town. 
<MAIN> Big city with a small town heart. 
<SACK> A college buddy of mine moved up to Manchester. He loves the place. ’ Maybe you know him. Skunk Baker? 
<MAIN> Sorry. Big city. Small town heart. But still a big city. 
<CLAIRE> Anyone want a beer? 
<MAIN> Hey, you know my buddy Dave's with Chase. I bet he knows him. 
<MAIN> And a bunch of corn chips. Great guy but he eats like a sea otter. 
<MAIN> We’re not out to sea five minutes before this guy blows like Krakatowa. I mean, it’s everywhere. It was like reliving the whole lunch. 
<MAIN> Poor guy. He should've stayed home. 
<MAIN> Yeah, I guess we are. 
<CLAIRE> No, no. I mean you. 
<MAIN> Very funny. 
<CLAIRE> Actually, that's why I hate the ocean. 
<MAIN> Me too! I hate anything that comes on like it's bigger than me. 
<CLAIRE> Exactly. The ocean has an attitude and I don't like it. 
<CLAIRE> I know. They're rude! And the mountains- - 
<MAIN> Oh, don't get me started on the mountains. 
<MAIN> You know what I like? Tide pools. No attitude from a tide pool. 
<CLAIRE> There are some amazing tide pools over on the other side of the island. We could bike over there this afternoon, if you like. 
<MAIN> I'd like that. It's a date. 
<MAIN> Sure. No problem, SEC. CLEARY Just start tacking back. 
<MAIN> Of course. Tack back. I was gonna tack back. Excellent choice, the tacking back. 
<MAIN> Tacking! 
<GLORIA> Jeremy!
<MAIN> What do you say we hit those tide pools? 
<CLAIRE> Sounds great. 
<RANDOLPH> Everything's ready for the quail hunt. There’s a jeep waiting to take you to the marsh. 
<MAIN> Uh, maybe, I’ll sit this one out. 
<JEREMY> Yeah, I think we’ll sit this one out. 
<CLAIRE> I'm afraid you're stuck. We’ll check out the tide pools later. 
<JEREMY> You hunt?! 
<SACK> I hunt quail. They're overpopulated on the island. They're decimating the grub worm population. Got a problem with that?! 
<JEREMY> Hey, it’s all good. 
<JEREMY> Have you ever shot one of these things before? 
<MAIN> Oh you bet. The whole fifteen years we've known each other? Well, I’ve been sneaking out to shoot at small birds. 
<JEREMY> What are we gonna do? I don't want to kill a quail. It's bad karma. 
<MAIN> You'll lie to young women to get them in bed but you won't shoot a little bird? 
<JEREMY> Right. 
<MAIN> Yeah, me too. But look, j.ust aim to miss.
<JEREMY> I thought the rifle just fired buckshot. 
<MAIN> Yeah. That's lead pellets, dumbfuck. It's’not a sling-shot. 
<JEREMY> Thank you. 
<SACK> There. Over by the spruce tree. 
<JEREMY> My ass! 
<MAIN> You okay, buddy? 
<JEREMY> Just fucking great!
<MAIN> He’s never been a silent sufferer. 
<JEREMY> Yeah sure. You kids go and have a good time. 
<GLORIA> Awww. Mr. Pogo isn’t jumping up -- 
<JEREMY> Well, sorry, Mr. Pogo gets stressed when Mr. Jeremy’s bleeding to death, okay? 
<SACK> Hey Randolph? 
<RANDOLPH> Sssh. I'm watching my stories, mon. 
<SACK> I just need to know where Claire is. 
<RANDOLPH> Uh -- she and that fellow went for a bike ride to the tidepools. 
<MAIN> So, it would be a total cliche if I kissed you right now, right? 
<CLAIRE> Yes. A total cliche. 
<SACK> Fuck. 
<CLAIRE> I can't do this. 
<SACK> Claire and I have an announcement to make. We were going to wait to tell all of you, but the spirit of this weekend is such that we can’t think of a better time to share our good news. 
<SACK> Claire and I are going to be married. 
<KATHLEEN> Wonderful! 
<CLAIRE> Sack -- we need to talk about this. 
<RANDOLPH> Oh, it's a marriage blessed by the angels, made in heaven, mon. 
<GLORIA> Jeremy and I have anannouncement to make, too. I'm going to be Mrs. Ryan! 
<JEREMY> What?! 
<KATHLEEN> Wonderful! 
<JEREMY> Oh well, game over. Thanks for playing. Maybe they'll have parting gifts. I’ll get my shit, we'll get out of here. 
<MAIN> You know what? I'm just gonna find her and tell her the truth. 
<JEREMY> The truth?! Okay. That might be a good call. You’re the. Prince of Arabia, you've rejected the throne --
<MAIN> Jeremy! The actual truth. 
<JEREMY> Oh. Wow. Okay, 
<JEREMY> It's not funny! 
<GLORIA> There you are! 
<JEREMY> Oh, hey, Gloria -- She opens a magazine in front of his face. 
<JEREMY> What's that? 
<GLORIA> It's a china pattern, silly. It's called Midnight Marakkesh. 
<JEREMY> Oh that's really nice -- 
<GLORIA> Excellent! It's sexy and you can eat off it. Just like me. 
<JEREMY> Oh, hello Father. 
<JEREMY> Ah, you know -- FATHER O’ NEIL Marriage is a big step. You sure you're ready? 
<JEREMY> Oh, gosh, uh, sure -- I'm ready, FATHER O’ NEIL C'mon, Son. What’s on your mind? 
<JEREMY> I'd like to make a confession. 
<JEREMY> It's all confidential, right? 
<JEREMY> I mean, you know -- FATHER O' NEIL You haven't been to church in a long time have you? Of course. It’s all confidential. 
<JEREMY> Well, see, that’s just it. I'm not a Catholic. 
<JEREMY> I'm a Jew. 
<TRAP> Sackster. 
<SACK> Trapster. 
<TRAP> Listen, about those guys -- EXT. BEACH - A MINUTE LATER 97 97 John is following Claire down the beach. She's walking at a brisk pace. 
<MAIN> C'mon Claire, wait up. 
<MAIN> So -- you’re 'marrying this guy, huh? 
<CLAIRE> Is that what you want to know? Well, you heard it back at the house. 
<MAIN> Look, you can't marry him. 
<CLAIRE> Why not? 
<MAIN> Um -- because I’m falling in love with you. 
<JEREMY> -- and my bar mitzvah had a Return of the Jedi theme which in retrospect I regret -- but anyway, the point is we're not venture capitalists. We're lawyers. And we do this, I mean we crash weddings in order to, uh -- FATHER O' NEIL Meet girls? 
<JEREMY> Yes, yes. Well, actually more than meet them. We, you know, hope to have sex with them. And, hey, if the band’s good and the spread's decent, that's just bonus points. 
<JEREMY> Actually, I slept with Gloria. Well, I didn't actually sleep with her. 
<JEREMY> We did it once at the beach at the wedding and then she -- 
<JEREMY> No, no. Get this! He thinks he's in love with her! Isn't that hilarious? See? That’s why we've been here so long! Normally we're in and out in a couple hours and -- FATHER O' NEIL
<JEREMY> Did I mention Todd has a crush on me? 
<JEREMY> Oh well, he does. He pretty much made that obvious after he gave me a self-portrait of his testicles. 
<CLAIRE> Why are you doing this to me, John? 
<MAIN> But, you -- maybe feel the same way? 
<CLAIRE> Maybe. 
<CLAIRE> Oh my god! 
<MAIN> What the hell?!
<JEREMY> Get the fuck outta here! Run! 
<MAIN> What’s going on?! 
<JEREMY> I spilled! I’m sorry. The Priest told me it was confidential! 
<CLAIRE> He spilled what?! 
<MAIN> Oh fuck! Look, Claire, I need to tell you something quickly. 
<SACK> They're lawyers, Claire. Those weren't even their real names! 
<SACK> They crash weddings in order to get laid! 
<MAIN> Claire, you don't understand! 
<CLAIRE> No, no, no. You son of a bitch! 
<TODD> Jeremy was going to be my lover! 
<GLORIA> I forgive you, Jeremy! Come back! 
<MAIN> Jeremy, I know how I can get to her. 
<JEREMY> Give it up. She's returned all your letters, she won’t take your calls. She doesn't want to see you, all right. 
<MAIN> She doesn't think she wants to see me. But trust me, she wants to see me. 
<JEREMY> Okay -- 
<MAIN> They're having an engagement party for her tonight at the Beach Club. We’re gonna be there. 
<JEREMY> We're? No. 
<MAIN> I need you to be my wing man. 
<MAIN> Oh yes we can. 
<JEREMY> How'd you find out about this? 
<RANDOLPH> Finally! Okay, mon, I got your uniforms. 
<RANDOLPH> What are you staring at, mon? Sack's a tool. 
<MICHAEL> Table five needs their soup. Muy pronto! 
<JEREMY> So? They're not my table. I haven’t even started yet.
<MICHAEL> Okay. Who am I? 
<JEREMY> You're the captain. 
<MICHAEL> That's right. Which makes me--? 
<JEREMY> Always right. 
<MICHAEL> That's right sweet-cheeks. Now get table five their soups. Comprende? 
<JEREMY> Yes. 
<MICHAEL> Yes, what?! 
<JEREMY> Yes, Captain. 
<MICHAEL> And you? Are we working -- working or are we, oh, just soaking in the atmosphere? 
<MAIN> Yes, Captain. I’m making coffee. That’s my assignment. 
<MICHAEL> Like your attitude. 
<JEREMY> Fine, i'll get you the chowder instead. 
<JEREMY> I know -- ELDERLY MAN The white one -- 
<JEREMY> I said I know -- ELDERLY MAN Not the red one! 
<JEREMY> I get it. 
<JEREMY> It’s ice water. That's part of the deal. 
<JEREMY> Okay --
<JEREMY> Because I'm not psychic? 
<JEREMY> Okay, you don't want ice? 
<JEREMY> There. No ice! 
<JEREMY> Hurry up. Talk to her. I can take about five more minutes of this shit. 
<MAIN> I've got to wait until she's alone. 
<JEREMY> It's an engagement party! Why would she be alone?! 
<MAIN> She’s got to go to the bathroom sometime. 
<MICHAEL> Lester, may I have a word with you? 
<MAIN> That’s you.
<JEREMY> -- and again, I am deeply sorry for my offensive words and terrible attitude. 
<MICHAEL> Sergio, what are we supposed to do with cranberry torte? 
<MAIN> What? 
<MICHAEL> I said what are we supposed to do with the cranberry torte? 
<MAIN> Uh -- drizzle it with Grand Marnier? 
<MICHAEL> That's right. And what did you do? 
<MAIN> I drizzled it with Grand Marnier -- 
<MICHAEL> 
<MAIN> Excuse me, Captain. Table three needs a -- We see Sack walk up to Claire and escort her back to the banquet room. John's lost his chance. 
<MAIN> I'll, uh, drizzle next time -- 
<MICHAEL> Please do. 
<JEREMY> I-I-I'm sorry. 
<JEREMY> Well it's not a coke spoon! 
<JEREMY> See? Teaspoon, soup spoon! Tea spoon, soup spoon! Jesus Christ!
<JEREMY> Get it yourself, you decrepit old- money cocksucker!! 
<JEREMY> Does anyone else need anything? Because I'm gonna take my break. 
<SACK> Do it, sweetheart! Please! 
<JEREMY> Okay. We're gonna want to run now. 
<MAIN> Oh not again! 
<SACK> These are the guys I warned you about. 
<SACK> No! Let me handle it! 
<TRAP> One more, Sackmaster, and then we have to finish up dinner. 
<MAIN> Nice job. 
<JEREMY> Oh? You didn't care for my performance as a waiter? Okay, well don't go to the fucking sequel, all right? 
<JEREMY> Dude, look, she’s just not worth it. 
<MAIN> You know, that’s what you said about Mary Theresa Spinolli. 
<MAIN> Mary Theresa Spinolli? Your Junior Prom date? 
<JEREMY> I know the story! I had to remind you of the story! 
<MAIN> Mary Theresa Spinolli was cheating on you with every guy in high school! You were in love with her! She broke your heart! 
<JEREMY> Are you fucking high? That was fifteen years ago! 
<MAIN> Mary Theresa Spinolli was your first love and she broke your heart! And because you had to be a man, because we all have to be "men," all you had to say about it was "she's just not worth it." 
<JEREMY> Okay, I think you have a concussion. 
<MAIN> Problem was you couldn't move on. And since then, none of them have been worth it! Right, Jeremy?! 
<JEREMY> You're an asshole. 
<MAIN> And now, because of that, we all have to pay the price! 
<JEREMY> What price is that, John?! 
<MAIN> Not growing up! Okay?! Pissing away our fucking lives living by some idiotic dumb-ass "rules!” Not growing up, Jeremy -- JEREMY
<JEREMY> This life -- crashing weddings, picking up women -- this life fits you perfectly. And you know why? Because you're a chronic liar. 
<MAIN> Fuck you. 
<JEREMY> See, crashing weddings, pretending to be someone you’re not to get laid? You don't do that in spite of who you are. You do that because of who you are! Don't get me wrong. It's a compliment. You're a genius at bullshit. That's why you're so good in the court room. And that's why you’re so good at crashing weddings. It's who you are. 
<MAIN> I'm outta here. 
<MAIN> All those weddings we went, to over the years. Didn't you once look at how happy the bride and groom were and wonder what that would be like? 
<JEREMY> No. 
<MAIN> I feel sorry for you. 
<MAIN> You know what? You're just not worth it. 
<JEREMY> Okay, don’t say anything! Not a word. Let me just say this. What you said outside the beach club? It was true. I mean, about thirty percent of it. 
<MAIN> You didn't fuck up anything. 
<MAIN> Well, I mean you did, but it wasn’t your fault. How could I ever expect to woo the woman of my dreams by crashing a wedding? It’s ridiculous. 
<JEREMY> Well, we did have fun -- at all of them. 
<MAIN> No doubt, my friend. 
<MAIN> I just need to make a new start. Preferably in a state where I'm not under a restraining order. 
<JEREMY> Yeah, I get that. It’s just I was thinking we should go out one more time before you leave. 
<MAIN> Yeah. That'd be great. What do you want to do? 
<JEREMY> Well, there's a wedding -- 
<MAIN> Jeremy -- 
<JEREMY> Come on. For old times' sake. 
<MAIN> No way. I'm done with that. 
<JEREMY> This’ll be the last one! A send off. Do it for me. Fifteen years of friendship -- INT. BOSTON CHURCH - LATER 118 118 John and Jeremy enter the church. They stop in the back.
<MAIN> You know this is the last time I'm doing this, right? 
<JEREMY> Absolutely. 
<MAIN> I don’t think I can do this -- 
<JEREMY> Sure you can. She's the woman of your dreams. 
<MAIN> Oh man -- 
<JEREMY> It’s your big moment. Dazzle the jury. 
<MAIN> Thanks. 
<JEREMY> You'll want to hurry up. I think they’re getting pretty close to the "I do" part. Which would be bad. 
<MAIN> Excuse me. 
<SACK> Security! 
<SACK> I don’t fucking believe this. 
<MAIN> Claire, it’s true, I met you because I crashed your sister's wedding. 
<MAIN> All right, all right! My point is I’ve changed. I guess I've grown up and I don't know why it took me so long but, well, maybe it's because I didn't see anything worth growing up for and now maybe I do and look, I don't know -- I'm sorry. I’m usually pretty articulate but -- I guess it's a lot harder when you're not bullshitting. 
<MAIN> Yes, I was. a liar. I was a liar because I was scared. But you know what, Claire? You’re scared too. You're scared to tell the truth about Sack. You're hot in love with that bozo. 
<SACK> Okay, I've had enough. 
<MAIN> In fact, I think you might be.in love with me. I know I'm in love with you. In fact, I love every single thing about you -- except for the fact you’re on that altar with another man. 
<MAIN> But, Claire, I’ve made a change in my life because of you and maybe you'd like to make a change because of me. 
<CLAIRE> I'm sorry, Sack. 
<SACK> Oh, you've got to be kidding! 
<JEREMY> Oh sorry, dude, I don't know what got into me. I’m seeing a Buddhist about it. 
<MAIN> Thanks, buddy. 
<JEREMY> My pleasure. 
<GLORIA> Jeremy! 
<TODD> Senator Frankel! 
<MAIN> Where to? 
<CLAIRE> I don’t know. Maybe Japanese. 
<JEREMY> Fujimora wedding! Salem. Three p.m. Great tempura. 
<CLAIRE> Place setting. 
<MAIN> Oh yeah. 
<JEREMY> Dude, you ready for this? 
<MAIN> Yeah, yeah -- of course. 
<JEREMY> Because you seem nervous -- 
<MAIN> I’m fine, I'm fine. 
<JEREMY> Dude, you’re going to be a groom next month! 
<MAIN> Oh, that I can deal with. Watching you do this, different story. 
<JEREMY> You know, we're going to be brothers-in-law.

<JEREMY> Oh yeah.
